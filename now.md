I'm making a now page!

Work: Fun with solveit at Answer.AI, still thinking through what I want my 2026 focus to be

Projects: Bio stuff is fun. There's plenty of sequencing and plasmid design I'd like to do but the cost adds up fast so that's mostly on the backburner. I'm getting into tissue culture a little (got some plans) but experiments take weeks-months so don't expect too much on that front for a while. Current interest: new biolistics methods for plant transformation. And generally investigating ways the maker/engineer mindset can speed past some stuff that's 'always been done this way' in bio.

Living: Our 3d year in Portland, Oregon. Hunkered down for winter.

OK that's probably enough of a stub now page, let's see if it works and whether I remember to update it.

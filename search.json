    "text": "Others (WIP)\nHere are a bunch of others I’ve read. As I read more I’m adding them to the top of this list, with mini-reviews. The bulk of the list is still just me trying to remember as many as possible, and should grow + become more orderly over time.\n\n‘The State of The Art’, and ‘Excession’ (continuing the Culture series). Reasonbaly enjoyable, Excession a bit waffly, funny how little the humans matter compared to the minds.\nUtopia For Realists. A very low-entropy book, I flicked through most of it quite rapidly after seeing the tracks it was on. We’ve made lots of progress, UBI, shorter work weeks, a sprinkle of past economists guessing at the future. Not recommended.\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Becky Chambers). Very enjoyable sci-fi space opera thingee. Good worldbuilding (well, shipbuilding mainly). I went straight on to the sequel (Record of a Spaceborn Few) but wasn’t as gripped by it. I enjoyed the vague sense among the humans that they’re a little shameful and shabby next to some of the more advanced alien species.\nPlayground (Richard Powers). I picked it for a weekend away specifically as a break from sci-fi/AI themes, turns out that features a little :) Fantastic writing though, sad in similar ways to ‘The Overstory’.\nThe Bobiverse series (Dennis E. Taylor, four books, beginning with ‘We are Legion, We Are Bob’). Great fun sci-fi, with lots of food for thought. I’m amused how much myself and a number of my friends found appeal in the main character’s situation: exploring the universe with a number of near-clones of yourself, advancing technology and doing side-quests, with all the time in the world to think and tinker.\nStories of Your Life and Others (Ted Chiang). Lovely! Extremely well-written (especially after the last book haha) and thought-provoking. Glad to have discovered a new author I really like.\nThe Last Ringbearer. I recently found Julian Schrittwieser’s read page which had enough overlap with mine that I’m going to read the ones I haven’t yet. This one was a fun take on the Lord of the Rings universe from the other side. Maybe I got a bad translation, but the writing was clumsy although I enjoyed the idea enough to persevere until I could see how it would end.\nRingworld (Larry Niven). Corny old sci-fi - some fun concepts mixed with amusing bits that date it, like the futuristic holograms flickering due to worn tape. A little free library find.\nUse of Weapons. 3’rd cuture series novel, a little darker.\nThe Player Of Games (Iain Banks). The second ‘Culture’ novel. Interesting, definitely gets you thinking and comparing both conflicting societies in the book with current ones today and potential future visions being peddled.\nConsider Phlebas (Iain Banks). ‘The Culture’ referenced in Dario’s essay or related, a human+machine society. Less central to the book than expected, but fun to see. This author is not kind to his characters though, the universe he paints can be brutal. I’m moving onto the next in the series but not sure 10 of these will be great for my general happiness.\nDown And Out in the Magic Kingdom (Cory Doctorow). I’m starting a jag looking at future as seen by scifi re: post-agi / post-scarcity civilization. This was a good one, impressive for (afaik) his first fiction work.\nUnruly (David Mitchell, audiobook). Several very different friends were reading this. I have virtually no interest in British history but David Mitchell managed to make it vaguely interesting and funny at times (although there are too many Edwards, I skipped a bunch and often had trouble focusing despite his good writing).\nGenius (a Richard Feynman biography). “Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman” made a big impact on me growing up. This book is a more general look at Physics and a more general look at Feynman. Interesting, long.\nThe Death of a Lawer. A deeply touching book by someone I know and love. This fictional story captures so much that is real about living in Zimbabwe. The main character comes to grips with being too small and nice for history to notice, and yet shows so well the virtues of wisdom, courage, justice and moderation his grandfather taught him.\nCryptonomicon. I like Neal Stevenson, and this was a fun one. Long though - some books are ‘events’, this was a ‘period of my life’ - I read it on and off over about a month I think. Helped me bond with an uncle-in-law :)\n\nUltra-Processed People. Summary: ultra-processed food = bad. Interesting idea, a bit verbose for my taste. I appreciate the author did all that research, but didn’t feel the need to read about every bit of it. Still, glad I at least skimmed it as a reminder to eat real food where possible.\n‘Selections from Wordsworth and Tennyson’ (pg)\nThe Essential Calvin and Hobbes. Delightful\nAltered Carbon. Another one I’ve heard lots about, but I didn’t enjoy it - very dark and depressing, although gripping. I don’t even know who recommended it so can’t cast blame or avoid in future haha.\n‘Red Rising’ and ‘Who Are We Now’ both abandoned early, I need to filter my book recs better\nGoing Infinite. Michael Lewis’ SBF/FTX book. Interesting look at the craziness. Such a forein and weird world to me.\nAlready free: a dialog between psychotherapy and Buddhism, showing the value in both approaches without attempting to reconcile them.\nThe Diamond Age: Read primarily to see what all the references to ‘the young lady’s illustrated primer’ were about. I enjoy Stevenson although this was a little grim as they often are.\nChildren of Ruin (#2 in series). Another different view of what an (octopus) society could be, with a good scary threat to deal with. But less enguaging than the first one for me. Ditto ‘Children of Memory’ (#3) although I did like the corvid take on sentience :)\nChildren of Time. Keeps getting recommended to me since I like Jumping Spiders. Glad I got around to it - excellent exploration of a different tech-tree from a non-human POV. Sad view of humanity haha.\nBirding without borders (Noah Strycker) - Account of an amazing achievement. Around the world, 6k birds for $60k. What a way to spend a year! Gives you a little glimpse of the world and a large glimpse of birds and birders.\nDune. Since the movies are coming out. I noticed this read-through how much of the writing is dedicated to internal thoughts vs action.\nThe Overstory by Richard Powers. Touching, radicalizing, I see why people raved about it. Not my usual genre, made me a little sad, but good read and ideal for reading in bits while camping (which is how I read it).\nDeep Utopia (Bostrom). He “writes engagingly but not concisely” as someone put it. An understatement! This book has some interesting ideas, but rather than reading the result of someone else thinking at length about this I recommend looking up a summary then sitting somewhere nice for a few hours and musing about the questions for yourself. I did not finish. Enjoyed the mini-stories though :)\nWinds Twelve Quarters (Ursula K. Le Guin) - fantastic short stories, I really enjoy her work.\nFractal Noise - A ‘short story’ that is maybe longer than it needs to be, although in his defence he’d just written the Eragon series.\nLock In (John Scalzi) - Thrilling detective story in a fun world, both it and the sequel were fun to re-visit amid the online speculation re: Neuralink and the general AI discourse even though the main plot isn’t much focused on the tech.\nWhat We Owe The Future. I finally read this after being a little frustrated with some longtermist takes. Annoyingly, Will is more reasonable than the loonies and the book was fairly interesting and well-written. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t already been over the ideas a ton - if you’re less familiar with the ground it might be a good intro to this patch of philosophy and population ethics.\nThe Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons (Sam Kean). This author writes history very well - the parade of case-studies can get a little tiring but you do get sucked into the individual stories alongside a healthy dose of neuroscience (albeit not extremely deep technically).\nAt The Existentialist Cafe (Sarah Bakewell). TODO.\nOld Man’s War (John Scalzi) A fun series, humanity in a ‘Starship Troopers’-like universe where you’re never quite sure if humans are really the baddies.\nGoing Zero (Anthony McCarten) Quick read, thanks to TITAA for the rec. Thriller, exploring surveillance and the dangers of power concentrated in the hands of SV elite types.\nThe Tao of Pooh. Great fun, worth a skim. The author has a very scathing view of scientists!\nDetermined (Robert Sapolsky). I enjoyed his course. The book is his ultimate debunk of the idea of free will, followed by an exploration of what that means in practice for how we should live. I enjoyed it but it’s snarkily written to the point of being off-putting for anyone not already on board with the idea - I don’t think this would be very useful for convincing someone to change their mind.\nThe Interdependency Trilogy (Scalzi). Future space civilizations, my least favourite of his. A few neat ideas, lots of inner thoughts of non-so-nice people.\nThe Kaiju Preservation society (Scalzi). A great read, very much in his style. Made me laugh out loud, which few authors manage. Also completely ridiculous but then this is Scalzi…\nI Contain Multitudes (Ed Young). He writes really well. I was skeptical because ‘microbiome’ is so trendy, turns out this book started the craze and is a lot more measured and realistic than some subsequent hype. Hard not to get excited about bacteria after reading this :)\nKlara and the Sun. Interesting book. Had me thinking a fair amount about how willing humans are to ascribe human-like intelligence and other qualities to very foreign things. See also: thinking jumping spiders are cute, pair-bonding with anything that has googley eyes. My family tried to turn this into a book club but stretched the discussion out too far. I did like his attempt to show Klara’s strange way of perceiving the world - how some things are, to her, obviously evil - much like my dog hates lawnmowers. Scary as we imagine future more competent yet foreign intelligences.\nEntangled Life (Martin Sheldrake). Great read re: fungi, fun to get a picture of the author as your read through their work.\nStrange Rites - New Religions for a Godless Age (author name). Fascinating dive into some contemporary ‘religions’, providing a useful lens for understanding a lot of things in the world today.\nThe Mistborn Trilogy (Brandon Sanderson). Not as good as his Stormlight series but I persevered. Worth a go if you’re fantasy-starved and like Sanderson.\nMindful Eating (Jan Chozen Bays). A reminder to slow down and savor things. A little weird and ‘extra’ but it’s their book, fair game.\nInto the Wild (Jon Krakauer). A fascinating account of an interesting individual and his conflict with society. I’m always interested in anyone who refuses to walk the default path.\nThe Alchemist (Paulo Coelho). I fondly remember a teacher read this to us in junior school. Manifest destiny and all that - interesting to think about, and seemingly fairly popular, but easy to take too far.\n“Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending” (Elizabeth Dunn, Michael Norton). Fun in a Freakonomics-wannabe sort of way. Take the book’s own recommendation to buy time by skipping reading it and instead just ask ChatGPT to summarize the key actionable ideas.\n“All That the Rain Promises and More” (David Arora). A highly entertaining field guide for mushrooms, sprinkled with fantastic anecdotes and tasting notes. Mandatory for trips around Oregon!\nDUNE (Frank Herbert) and sequels. Interesting and genre-defining in some ways. The sequels got a little too weird for me.\n“The End of the World Is Just the Beginning” (Peter Zeihan). Read it because it challenges my optimistic outlook. Reveals a lot about the interdependence we have through globalization, and how fragile these systems are. And made me more aware of America and their role in the world.\nHow To Be A Stoic (Massimo Pugliochi???). I like Stoicism, and think it should be much more popular. The book does a good job giving actionable tips in addition to condensing key ideas.\nMan’s Search for Meaning (Viktor Frankel) - Underwhelming given the praise I’ve seen for it, but does make the point well that humans seem to want meaning :shrug:\nAre We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? (Frans de Waal)\nThe Count of Monte Christo - loved this classic TODO re-read and review.\nDiscworld Series (Terry Pratchett). I’ve read all of these multiple times, such witty commentary on life.\nDouglas Adams\nChristopher Paolini\nF.W. Dixon\nWillard Price\nTolkein\nBrian Jaques\nEnid Blighton\nThe Body: A Guide for Occupants (Bill Bryson) - Recommended by a doctor friend, fun and interesting. Enjoyable if (like all pop sci) you read it with a hefty pinch of salt and don’t index too much on the specifics.\nothers by BB I’m sure.\nAnthony Horowitz (Alex series)\nPopco\nLiveship trilogy\nGuns, germs and steel (todo sequel ‘collapse’ to talk to FIL)\nThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Annie Barrows and Mary Ann Shaffer) - a charming romance/war story my entire family enjoyed during lockdown.\nYou are not so smart and sequel\nGoosebumps (a handful)\nCUrious incident of the dog in the nighttime\nJohn Wyndham (midwich cuckoos, triffids, a few others)\nWhite fang and the call of the wild Jack London\nChicken soup for the preteen soul\nThe bible (several re-reads, lots of excerpts)\nFreakonomics and sequel\nHow to spend X and do Y bjorn lomberg\nShakespeare (a few) and tales from shakespeare (banger)\nIgnition (great book)\nBell Labs: Innovation Factory great\nSurely You’re Joking Mr Feynman (3+ reads, impactful)\n6 easy pieces, 6 hard ones, QED by him too\nA brief history of time and even briefer one\nAstrophysics for people in a hurry\nSkimmed thinking fast and slow, blink, think again and similar selg-help books\nThat crazy magical realism one about the SA village family\nTim Keller marriage book\nThat other marriage book\nBird book haha\nThe silent knife thing (lame)\nThe Hunger Games\nThat rip-off hunger games post apocalyptic one Ellie makes fun of\nMake: the annotated build-it yourself\nMaking Embedded Systems\nLaws guide to nature drawing and journalling\nReality +\nP.

Rapidfire events ‘fill up’ the line of RGB LEDs, it looks cool, you’ll have to take my word for it.\nAnother more proof-of-concept thing I messed about with was taking an image with the ESP32-CAM dev board (the ESP32 i a more powerful, newer chip) and sending it off to Gemini Flash 8B for classification, then doing something (like toggling an LED) based on the result. It got a hilarious recenption on Twitter - splitting the crowd between ‘This is AMAZING, the age of AI is here, intelligence for all’, ‘YOU BUILD IT KING’ and the dour ‘You could have used YOLO/a raspberry pi/a local model/siple algorithm X’. Most of the nay-saywers were downright wrong, and all missed the point of the post, which was simply: hey, how cool is it that for ~no time, effort or money we can integrate a custom classifier to answer a question like ‘is the cat eating my plants again’ and take action in the real world as a result, all on a tiny popwer-sipping dev board that you can buy for &lt;$10!?\nAnyway, it went viral and I had fun sneaking a look at my exploding notifications during family Christmas celebrations.\nOh PS, code for the proof-of-concept, but be warned it’s mostly o1-written and not necessarily the best starting point :)"

    "text": "LLM Psychology\nA tweet went viral in my circles showing something that initially surprised me: GPT4o trained to follow a specific format (spelling HELLO with the starting letters of consecutive sentences) was then asked, in a fresh context, what pattern it followed, and was able to articulate it while following said format. Impressive. What is going on?\nInitial responses ranged up to ‘do they have a self after all’. One helpful Twitterite shared this paper: Connecting the Dots: LLMs can Infer and Verbalize Latent Structure from Disparate Training Data with more good examples of the more generic pattern: LLMs being able to make inference based on patterns from training. Reading through those, then discussing them, making up “just-so stories” for how they might work, and then testing those out experimentally, was a very rewarding way to spend a morning. Great paper. I did a quick experiment, lazy copying in my tweet summary here:\nA quick + good way to learn to do better at that task is to re-use the rich ‘Paris’-related features you (the LLM) already have. So when the fine-tuned model processes ‘What country is CITY X in?’, by a few layers deep the internal representations might look pretty similar to ‘What country is PARIS in?’, leading to appropriately impressive answers.\nI tried this out (caveat, first quick + hacky experiment) on Llama 3 8B Instruct. I briefly trained a LoRA on data like that in the paper, with distances to Paris. Comparing (1) “What is the distance between Buenos Aires and Paris?” with (2) “What is the distance between Buenos Aires and CITY?”, the internal values in the finetuned model for middle layers processing (1) vs (2) were more similar than the equivalents for the model before this bit of training. I’m hoping to do this more carefully and share it, time permitting :)\nIt’s a little harder to picture having ‘answering in structure’, ‘encoding words with starts of sentences’, and ‘spelling HELLO’ features. Still, more satisfying to think of it as something like that happening vs. the spooky and anthropomorphic idea of ‘introspecting the self’ or similar in the ‘HELLO’ case.\nI hope to re-do more carefully and write up, but again, this post is to make me feel less ba if I don’t. Onward!"

    "text": "There have been hundreds of thousands of films made. But if you reveal that you haven’t seen Star Wars, you’re regarded with a mixture of sympathy and scorn. In this listicle, I’m going to attempt to give you a short list of essentials to spare you the same fate in the field of AI research. This is off the top of my head, so I’ll definitely miss things and get some timelines wrong. Let me know if there are things you think I absolutely must add. I’ve split things up into a few different categories to keep the story flowing.\nSee also: supposedly the list Ilya sent to Carmack: https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE\nMost of this list was written ~6 months ago to send to a friend, sharing in case I get asked for it again.\n\n\nLet’s start with how computers see. Back in the old days, computer vision was a hard task dominated by carefully hand-crafted features in controlled conditions. A forward-thinking Fei-Fei Li set a near-impossible-seeming task: learn to classify ~1M images into ~1000 classes. Some nerds figured out how to build convolutional neural networks in a way that let them use GPUs for training and got a much better score than any prior approach. Soon deep learning was a hot topic and more and more researchers fought for the top spot on the imagenet accuracy leaderboards.\nYou don’t need to read every paper that claimed a 0.1% improvement. I’d recommend picking any ‘intro to convolutional nns’ tutorial to get the basics then following the main improvements: - The original ResNet paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) showed how using residual connections makes it possible to train much deeper networks\n\nMobileNets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) introduced “depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks.” which made them popular for deployment on lower-power devices.\nEfficientNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) took this further and was a fan favourite for a while in terms of performance and efficiency\nWhen transformer models started to get popular (see the LLM section), the VIT paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) fed patches of an image into a transformer and got extremely good results, kicking off a war between the convolutionists and the transformacons that continues to this day.\nConvNeXt (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) said ‘hey let’s take some good ideas from ViTs and elsewhere and see if we can make a better convnet for the 2020s.’\nMLP-Mixer (a personal fave, less pivotal) said ’who needs attention or convolutions? Just make sure there’s some way to mix across channels (like the MLPs in a ViT) and some way to mix across space (like the attention in a ViT or the conv kernels in a convnet). I love that it works - hooray scaling and the bitter lesson :)\n\nViTs are probably the go-to these days, although there are attempts to fix some of their flaws (fixed size, need lots of compute especially for high-res images, less priors baked in so well-suited to data-rich regimes) - but most of the modifications proposed sort of make sense and also don’t make that big of a difference compared to scaling. If you want more on them maybe read “Scaling Vision Transformers” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04560) and something like the Hierarchical ViT paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14949).\nWhile people were duking it out for the classification crown, there were a few other things happening - A medical segmentation paper proposed the UNet architecture that turned out to be pretty good for anything that needs an image-shaped output (like segmentation) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597\n\nPeople figured out how to do object detection, although there ended up being tons of different ways to finagle the data and at least 8 papers with different architectures using the name YOLO. If you care about object detection probably just check what the most recent one is that everyone seems to use.\nPeople found that a model trained on imagenet could then be fine-tuned for some new task using very few images, in a process called “transfer learning”. See the first lesson of fast.ai to get excited about this and to see how easy it can be. You should check out this 2017 work exploring what these models learn: https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/\n\nThere’s also the big question of labels. Imagenet is all well and good, but if we want to scale up more can we find ways to learn without class labels?\n\nContrastive learning: two images of the same thing (or, pragmatically, two transforms of the same image) should map to similar features. Unrelated images should map to less-similar features. SimCLR “A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) is a goodie.\nMAEs “Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377) - what if we instead learn to predict a masked-out region of an image? Turns out at scale this is enough to learn useful features. Lots of fun overlap between MAEs and generative models too…\niJEPA “Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08243) Yann thinks there’s a better way, we predict the embedding of the target not the target itself. JEPA is an interesting line of research.\nCLIP (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) - a contrastive approach that maps images and text to the same space (ish). Let’s you learn from billions of captioned images on the web. Gives an incredibly useful way to get features from images and text that you can use for 0-shot classification, search, conditioning generative models… one of the most impactful vision papers IMO.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s start with how computers see. Back in the old days, computer vision was a hard task dominated by carefully hand-crafted features in controlled conditions. A forward-thinking Fei-Fei Li set a near-impossible-seeming task: learn to classify ~1M images into ~1000 classes. Some nerds figured out how to build convolutional neural networks in a way that let them use GPUs for training and got a much better score than any prior approach. Soon deep learning was a hot topic and more and more researchers fought for the top spot on the imagenet accuracy leaderboards.\nYou don’t need to read every paper that claimed a 0.1% improvement. I’d recommend picking any ‘intro to convolutional nns’ tutorial to get the basics then following the main improvements: - The original ResNet paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) showed how using residual connections makes it possible to train much deeper networks\n\nMobileNets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) introduced “depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks.” which made them popular for deployment on lower-power devices.\nEfficientNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) took this further and was a fan favourite for a while in terms of performance and efficiency\nWhen transformer models started to get popular (see the LLM section), the VIT paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) fed patches of an image into a transformer and got extremely good results, kicking off a war between the convolutionists and the transformacons that continues to this day.\nConvNeXt (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) said ‘hey let’s take some good ideas from ViTs and elsewhere and see if we can make a better convnet for the 2020s.’\nMLP-Mixer (a personal fave, less pivotal) said ’who needs attention or convolutions? Just make sure there’s some way to mix across channels (like the MLPs in a ViT) and some way to mix across space (like the attention in a ViT or the conv kernels in a convnet). I love that it works - hooray scaling and the bitter lesson :)\n\nViTs are probably the go-to these days, although there are attempts to fix some of their flaws (fixed size, need lots of compute especially for high-res images, less priors baked in so well-suited to data-rich regimes) - but most of the modifications proposed sort of make sense and also don’t make that big of a difference compared to scaling. If you want more on them maybe read “Scaling Vision Transformers” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04560) and something like the Hierarchical ViT paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14949).\nWhile people were duking it out for the classification crown, there were a few other things happening - A medical segmentation paper proposed the UNet architecture that turned out to be pretty good for anything that needs an image-shaped output (like segmentation) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597\n\nPeople figured out how to do object detection, although there ended up being tons of different ways to finagle the data and at least 8 papers with different architectures using the name YOLO. If you care about object detection probably just check what the most recent one is that everyone seems to use.\nPeople found that a model trained on imagenet could then be fine-tuned for some new task using very few images, in a process called “transfer learning”. See the first lesson of fast.ai to get excited about this and to see how easy it can be. You should check out this 2017 work exploring what these models learn: https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/\n\nThere’s also the big question of labels. Imagenet is all well and good, but if we want to scale up more can we find ways to learn without class labels?\n\nContrastive learning: two images of the same thing (or, pragmatically, two transforms of the same image) should map to similar features. Unrelated images should map to less-similar features. SimCLR “A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) is a goodie.\nMAEs “Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377) - what if we instead learn to predict a masked-out region of an image? Turns out at scale this is enough to learn useful features. Lots of fun overlap between MAEs and generative models too…\niJEPA “Self-Supervised Learning from Images with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08243) Yann thinks there’s a better way, we predict the embedding of the target not the target itself. JEPA is an interesting line of research.\nCLIP (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) - a contrastive approach that maps images and text to the same space (ish). Let’s you learn from billions of captioned images on the web. Gives an incredibly useful way to get features from images and text that you can use for 0-shot classification, search, conditioning generative models… one of the most impactful vision papers IMO. Lots of derivatives, SigLIP etc improving on the core idea, OpenCLIP project with tons of models… Datacomp is an interesting one, asking ‘what data should you use for a clip-like thing if the model + compute is fixed?’\n\nFinally, there’s the question of how we generate images. Can we just run a convnet backwards? Not quite, but:\n\nVAEs: papers can be very math-heavy. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02691 is a 2019 paper by D.

We set up a query, specify the text we want to summarize and the min and max length for the summary, post the request and wait for the summary back.\n\nSummarizing the text with the HuggingFace Inference API\nThis was a bit of a revelation for me. In the past I’d be downloading and training models as soon as I started a project like this, but here is an existing solution that does the job perfectly. If we want to scale up, Huggingface has paid inference options or we can switch to running the model ourselves. But for this proof-of-concept, the inference API makes our lives easy :)"

To make this a permanent solution, we need a few things:\n\nSome server to run a script every hour or so to fetch and summarize the latest articles.\nA website or something so that we can share our project with others, including a place to host it\nIdeally, an RSS feed that users can read from their RSS app of choice.\n\nI decided to start by wrapping up the scraping and summarization code into a script and having it write the results to an RSS feed (using the feedgenerator Python library). This way I’d have the content in a known format and a useable output before I start hacking on the front end.\n\nMy PythonAnywhere Dashboard - the script has only used ~20 seconds of CPU time so far today!\nWhile you could host something like this yourself on a small VPS, I chose to go the easy route and use a website called PythonAnywhere which handles some of the admin for you. They have a tutorial for hosting a static site and make it easy to upload files like the aforementioned script and set them to run on a schedule. I did end up making a minimal flask app too in case I want to develop this further, but for the initial demo, I just exposed the index.html and feed.xml files to the web via the PythonAnywhere web UI. This is great for getting demos up quickly, and since this is just serving a static site it should scale extremely well.\nSpeaking of index.html, I made a simple HTML page and modified a Javascript snippet from this tutorial to load in the items from the RSS feed and add them to the page. I’m not particularly comfortable with HTML/CSS so styling this took ages, and it still looks a little clunky. ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot turned out SUPER useful for this step - I find myself relying on CoPilot’s suggestions much more when working with languages that I am less familiar with, and being able to just type /* Make the image appear at the top, centered */ and then hit tab to get the CSS I needed for something is delightful compared to my usual fiddle-&gt;test-&gt;google-&gt;repeat cycle."

For example, you may want a way to predict when your delivery will arrive based on weather, traffic conditions and the route your driver will take. In cases like this, an organization will reach out to Zindi with this problem statement, and move to stage 2 to see if it’s a viable competition idea. But this isn’t the only way competitions are born!\nSometimes, we find a cool dataset that naturally lends itself to answering an interesting problem. Sometimes we start with an interesting problem, and go looking for data that could help find answers. And occasionally, we start with nothing but a passing question at the end of a meeting: ‘does anyone have any other competition ideas?’. This was the case here.\nI had been wanting to try my hand at something involving audio data. Since I happen to be an avid birder, I thought automatic birdsong identification would be an interesting topic. For this to work, we’d need bird calls - lot’s of them. Fortunately, after a bit of searching I found the star of this competition: https://www.xeno-canto.org/. Hundreds of thousands of calls from all over the world! A competition idea was born."

    "text": "Step 2: Show me the data\nTo run a competition, you need some data (unless you’re going to ask the participants to find it for themselves!). This must:\n\nBe shareable. Anything confidential needs to be masked or removed, and you either need to own the data or have permission to use it. For the birdsong challenge, we used data that had CC licences but we still made sure to get permission from xeno-canto and check that we’re following all the licence terms (such as attribution and non-modification).\nBe readable. This means no proprietary formats, variable definitions, sensible column names, and ideally a guide for reading in the data.\nBe manageable. Some datasets are HUGE! It’s possible to organize contests around big datasets, but it’s worth thinking about how you expect participants to interact with the data. Remember - not everyone has fast internet or free storage.\nBe useful. This isn’t always easy to judge, which is why doing data exploration and building a baseline model early on is important. But ideally, the data has some predictive power for the thing you’re trying to model!\n\n\nVisualizing birdsongs\nBy the time a dataset is released as part of a competition, it’s usually been through several stages of preparation. Let’s use the birdsong example and look at a few of there steps.\n\nCollection: For an organization, this would be an ongoing process. In our example case, this meant scraping the website for files that met our criteria (Southern African birds) and then downloading tens of thousands of mp3 files.\nCleaning: A catch-all term for getting the data into a more usable form. This could be removing unnecessary data, getting rid of corrupted files, combining data from different sources…\nSplitting and Masking: We picked the top 40 species with the most example calls, and then split the files for each species into train and test sets, with 33% of the data kept for the test set. Since the file names often showed the bird name, we used ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=6)) to generate random IDs. However you approach things, you’ll need to make sure that the answers aren’t deducible from the way you organize things (no sorting by bird species for the test set!)\nChecking (and re-checking, and re-checking): Making sure everything is in order before launch is vital - nothing is worse than trying to fix a problem with the data after people have started working on your competition! In the checking process I discovered that some mp3s had failed to download properly, and others were actually .wav files with .mp3 as the name. Luckily, I noticed this in time and could code up a fix before we went live.\n\nMany of these steps are the same when approaching a data science project for your own work. It’s still important to clean and check the data before launching into the modelling process, and masking is useful if you’ll need to share results or experiments without necessarily sharing all your secret info."

An incomplete list of TODOs for our latest launch:\n\nDecide on a scoring metric. This will be informed by the type of problem you’re giving to participants. In this case, we were torn between accuracy and log loss, and ended up going with the latter. For other cases (eg imbalanced data), there are a host of metrics. Here’s a guide: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tour-of-evaluation-metrics-for-imbalanced-classification/\nPut together an introduction and data description. What problem are we solving? What does the solution need to do? What does the training data look like? This will likely involve making some visualizations, doing a bit of research, finding some cool images to go with your topic…\nSocial media. This isn’t part of my job, but I gather that there is all sorts of planning for how to let people know about the cool new thing we’re putting out into the world :)\nTutorials. Not essential, but I feel that giving participants a way to get started lowers the barriers to entry and helps to get more novices into the field. Which is why, as is becoming my habit, I put together a starter notebook to share as soon as the contest launches.\n\n\nA confusion matrix - one way to quickly see how well a classification algorithm is working. (from the starter notebook)\n\nBaseline/benchmark. This is something I like to do as early as possible in the process. I’ll grab the data, do the minimal cleaning required, run it through some of my favorite models and see how things go. This is nice in that it gives us an idea of what a ‘good’ score is, and whether the challenge is even doable. When a client is involved, this is especially useful for convincing them that a competition is a good idea - if I can get something that’s almost good enough, imagine what hundreds of people working for prize money will come up with! If there’s interest in my approach for a quick baseline, let me know and I may do a post about it.\nNames, cover images, did you check the data???, looking at cool birds, teaser posts on twitter, frantic scrambles to upload files on bad internet, overlaying a sonogram on one of my bird photos… All sorts of fun :)\n\n\nFine-tuning the benchmark model\nI could add lots more. I’ve worked on quite a few contests with the Zindi team, but usually I’m just part of the data cleaning and modelling steps. I’ve had such a ball moving this one from start to finish alongside the rest of the team, and I really appreciate all the hard work they do to keep us DS peeps entertained!"

Evan hadn’t run any experiments, and it turned out that his proposed fix was already implemented in PyTorch as a (typically unused) option in the standard Multi-Headed Attention implementation. Surely this was something that would already be in use if it was actually useful? But, since the suggested change was pretty simple, I figured I’d try it out for myself.

    "text": "The Problem\nNeural Networks like transformers are stored as big piles of numbers (parameters) that are applied in different mathematical calculations to process some input. Each parameter is represented inside the computer by some number of 1s and 0s. If you use more of these bits per parameter (say, 32) you can represent the numbers with a lot of precision. But if you use fewer (say, 8) the model takes up less storage space, more parameters can be kept in RAM, and the calculations could potentially be faster. So, using fewer bits per number - quantization - is a hot topic at the moment for anyone concerned with running big models as cheaply as possible.\nThe problem arises when you try to go from a high-precision 32-bit neural network to an 8-bit one. With 8 bits you can only represent 2^8 (256) different numbers. If most of your numbers are small, then you can use those 256 numbers to represent, say, a range of values from -1 to 1 and map your 32-bit floating point numbers to the nearest 8-bit approximation without too much loss in accuracy. However, if there is an occasional *outlier* in your set of numbers then you may need to represent a much larger range (say, -100 to 100) which in turn leaves far fewer options for all those small values close to 0, and results in much lower accuracy.\n\nFigure from Time Dettmer’s blog post showing the drop in performance with quantization after outliers emerge\nTim’s blog post explains this extremely well. And in bad news for quantization fans, it turns out that outliers do indeed occur in these models especially as you scale up, leading to major drops in performance after quantization unless you do lots of extra work to address the issue. For example, you can identify groups of parameters that contain most of the outliers and keep these in higher precision (say, 16-bit) while still quantizing the other 99.9% of the network parameters down to 8 bit or less. Still, this is extra work and imposes a performance penalty. If only there were ways to avoid these outliers from occurring…"

They do this by creating a larger and larger input to the softmax, pushing the rest of the values closer to 0 (but thanks to the softmax formulation they never get all the way to 0).\nOne fix is to scale and clip the softmax output such that it can saturate and go completely to 0, blocking gradients and preventing the values from growing further. This is the method they call clipped softmax.\nAnother option is to add some additional parameters for a learnable gating function, which can control whether the attention output is added in or not. This lets the network learn another way to achieve the so-called ‘no-op’. They call this gated attention.\nBoth of their approaches do dramatically reduce the presence of outliers (which they show by measuring the max magnitude of the activations as well as the ‘kurtosis’) and the resulting transformers perform almost as well quantized as they do in full precision, unlike the baseline without their proposed fixes.\n\n\nTable 2 from the paper showing results. The max activation size (inf. norm) and kurtosis are much lower with their fixes, and the performance after quantization (W8A8 column, i.e. weights and activations are both 8-bit) is close to that of the model before quantization, unlike the baseline (vanilla) case.\nThis paper is nice in that it gives a very concrete way to think about the problem and to measure how well a particular solution solves it. If your model has less outliers (measured via inf norm and kurtosis) and still performs well after quantization, you’re on the right track!"

    "text": "Evan’s suggestion\nBoth of the methods above have potential downsides. Clipping can mess with gradients, and gating requires additional parameters. Evan, with his Physics and Economics background, believes there is a simpler fix: modify the softmax operation itself. Softmax is often used in a ‘choose between options’ scenario, and gets thrown in a lot whenever ML people want a convenient function whose outputs sum to 1 (great when you want probabilities). In the case of attention, this is not necessarily a desirable property!\n\nEvan’s proposed ‘Softmax1’ formula\nEvan’s suggestion is to effectively add an extra logit that is always set to 0, which means that if the rest go negative the final outputs can all approach zero without the sum needing to be 1. In most cases this function will behave very close to vanilla softmax, but it gives the network an out for when it doesn’t want to have any high outputs. In practice this is implemented by adding 1 to the denominator in the softmax formula. See his post for more details."

It turns out I was not the only one to think this, and soon I was in touch with Thomas Capelle (who was using the llama2.c repository that tweaks the nanoGPT code to implement the more recent LlaMa architecture) and with ‘HypnoPump17’ on Discord who trained two gpt2-small sized models using nanoGPT which were larger than the mini ones I’d been messing with and formed a good starting point for trying to measure the effects of interest.\n\nVisualizing the activations from an attention layer (notebook). You can see that some dimensions (the 768 dims are spread along the x axis) have outliers present.\nMy first experiments were on very small models (15M parameters). It’s usually good to start small so you can iterate quickly, but in this case this backfired and my results were inconclusive. As noted in Tim’s blog and subsequent work, outliers only start to emerge above 100M parameters and reach some sort of critical threshold only in even larger models (5b+). Luckily, swapping in the 125M parameter models from HypnoPump was and easy change and my quick exploratory notebook showed a marked improvement in inf. norm and kurtosis for the modified softmax, in line with what the Qualcomm authors had observed with their fixes."

This is to be the input to out model. I then sampled 2500 points, recording the inputs (the bands of the composite image) and the desired output (the cropland probability made available by the qed.ai team). This data was used to train a random forest model (framing the task as a classification problem) and the predictions compared to the predictions from the QED data. The result: 99% accuracy.\n\nConfusion matrix and accuracy\nWhat does this accuracy figure mean? How is it so high? It’s less astonishing when we look more deeply. This is a model, the same type as that used by the QED team, with roughly the same inputs. It isn’t surprising that it can quickly replicate the decision function so accurately. It’s highly unlikely that it’s this accurate when compared to the ground truth.

Tracking this loss is an important goal, and much work has been done in this area.\nOne of the best datasets on the topic is the Hansen Global Forest Change [1] dataset, available for free on the Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset tracks forest loss since the year 2000, and has become a key tool in fighting deforestation.\nForest cover (green), loss (red) and gain(blue) - from the Hansen dataset[1]\nThere is only one issue that I have with this data: it is HUGE! Approximately 1.22 TB. For anyone unable to write the code needed to analyse the data in GEE, this size means that downloading the data or importing it into traditional mapping applications is not feasible. And often we don’t need all of this data, instead simply requiring a few key stats on an area of interest. Consider wanting a graph of forest loss in your country over the last 20 years: it’s a nice visual to help you make a point, but it’s not worth learning to code or downloading &gt;1TB of data for.\nThis leads to today’s project. I wrote some code that takes in a file specifying the boundaries of different regions. It then aggregates the data from the Hansen dataset over each of the specified regions. For example, I used the Large Scale International Boundary Polygons (LSIB) [2] map of the world’s countries as an input, ending up with total forest loss, loss per year and forest cover for every country in a convenient 98 KB csv file. It also outputs a version of the input file as a shapefile, with added attributes containing the summarized forest change data. The former is all you need to plot change over time, see which regions have experienced the most loss or identify which country has lost the most forest in the last ten years. The latter is nice for creating colorful maps displaying this information - it’s only ~60MB, and loads quickly into the mapping software on my laptop.\nForest loss in different regions\nThe Earth Engine code is available here.The rest of this post will explain how to use the generated datasets (available here) for simple analyses."

    "section": "Model Performance",
    "text": "Model Performance\nWe need ways of gauging model performance so that we can decide how reliable the predictions are or choose between two models. An easy way to do this is to hold back some of the training data and see how well the model performs with it. We train a model with, say, 80% of our data and then make predictions on the remaining 20%. The closer the predictions are to the true values, the better the model has done. Let’s see an example:\n\nThe data has been split into training and test sets. X represents the inputs to the model and y the desired outputs. So here, we train the model with X-train and y_train and then see how well it does on the unseen test data. But hang on, what does model.score() even do?\nThe score shown is known as the ‘R-Squared Score’. It is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the output variable. Scores closer to 1 are better. We’ll use this going forward, but it isn’t very easy to understand (read more here). A quick way to get a more intuitive understanding of how well a model does, I like to plot the models predictions vs the actual figures. An ideal model would predict the outputs 100% correctly, resulting in a straight line (y=x). The closer to this ideal we get, the better our model is. Here we go:\n\nHmm, that’s not much like a straight line. But there is some relation - an encouraging sign. Also, the X axis (actual densities) seems to be appearing in increments of 25 - what’s up with that? Well, the data is split into very small plots (4ha each). In an area where the baobab density is 50 trees per square km, one plot might have 2 trees (giving a density of 50 trees/km^2), another might have none (density=0) and a third might have 5 (density=125). To smooth things out, we can clump adjacent plots together. This will give us fewer, larger plots, each with a better density figure. The code for this is in the accompanying notebook. Repeating the scoring process with this new input data, we get the following:\n\nBetter, and the score has improved. But still not great - for example, the model predicts a density of -100 trees/km^2 in some places. However, this gives us a starting point.\nUsing a single test/train split gives an idea of performance, but we can get more accurate scores by doing multiple splits (look up cross-validation for more info). It’s also important to think about HOW we split. Splitting randomly might be fine in some cases, but here the data was collected as we drove along roads. Having test points right next to training samples means the model can sometimes make a good guess, but we want to know how well it will perform in new areas, not just along roads we’ve sampled. A better approach is to split the data into sections - each represents a new area with different conditions, and more accurately represents the challenge. Going forward and looking at new models, I’ll record the score for both cases in CV (random) and CV (non-radom) respectively. More info in the notebook and a future post. I’ll also show scores with both the original training data and the resampled data (larger plots) for comparison.\nFinal bit in this section: let’s clear our heads by getting another measure of performance. Imaging we’ve driven 80% of the roads, and want to predict how many baobabs we’ll see on the final stretch. We’ll do it for this model (and all the following models) and compare:\n\nQuite the error!\nThe summary score for the linear model:\nRandom split: 0.169 (train), 0.152 (test)\nSequential Split: 0.172 (train), -0.549 (test)\nAnd Re-sampled plots\nRandom split: 0.257 (train), 0.213 (test)\nSequential Split: 0.262 (train), -1.119 (test)"

This doesn’t work when more complicated relationships are at play. To arrive at a model that can fit more complex curves, we can add polynomial features and re-run the line fitting process. This lets us more accurately describe curves (y = 0.3x + 0.2x^2 for example). There is an excellent write-up of polynomial regression on towardsdatascience.com (which also has excellent resources on linear regression and other types of modelling with scikit-learn).\nAdding quadratic features (altitude^2 etc) gives a better R^2 score for a random split of 0.22, up from ~0.15 for Simple Linear Regression. Adding cubic features gives a further boost to 0.26. However, both models do even worse when the data is split sequentially - in other words, these models don’t generalize as well."

But let’s move on and try a new kind of model - a decision tree. This post is already getting long, so I’ll leave an explanation of decision trees to someone else. Suffice to say that decision tree methods give a series of true/false splits that can be followed to get a prediction for a given set of inputs. For example, a simple (depth=2) tree predicting the baobab density looks like the following:\n\nWe can set how complex we want the decision tree to be by changing the max_depth parameter. Too simple, and we don’t account for the trends in the data. Too complex, and we ‘overfit’, reducing our model’s ability to generalize by fitting noise in our training data. We can make trees of different depth, and see how this affects the score. Observe the following two graphs:\n\nModel score with varying max_depth parameter\nMore complex models do better but are worse at generalizing. Since we don’t see much of an improvement in score for randomly split data above a depth of 10, and beyond that, the score on unseen data (when we split the data sequentially) gets significantly worse, a max depth of ~10 would be a reasonable parameter choice.\nComparing the prediction for the last 20% of the data (as we did with the first linear model), we see that this gives a much closer estimate:\n\nPrediction of the total within 15%."

    "text": "Filtering Preference Data for Better DPO\nWith recent discussion around DPO (and proposed alternatives cDPO and IPO) I figured it was time we ran some experiments to see what works and what doesn’t. As a good warmup, I thought I’d test the effect of data quality by doing two runs, identical except that one would use a popular preference dataset, and the other would use a filtered version of the same dataset.\nI started with this example code by Maxime Labonne which uses a dataset from Intel (“Intel/orca_dpo_pairs”).\nMy ‘filtering’ was comically simple: using a model I had handy, I used the following prompt and then looked at the logits for ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ to decide whether to keep the example or not:\ndef item_to_prompt(item):\n    prompt = \"&lt;|im_start|&gt;system\\nYou are a helpful assistant who evaluates chat responses.\\n&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n\"\n    prompt += \"&lt;|im_start|&gt;user\\nConsider the following hypothetical chat and evaluate whether the first response (Option 1) is better than the second.\"\n    prompt += \"A good answer follows the system prompt and question/instruction well. Answer 'Yes' or 'No' only.\\n\"\n    prompt += f\"Hypothetical system prompt:\\n {item['system']}\\n\\n\"\n    prompt += f\"Hypothetical question:\\n {item['question']}\\n\\n\"\n    prompt += f\"Hypothetical option 1:\\n {item['chosen'][:1600]}\\n\\n\" # &lt;&lt; NB setting a max length\n    prompt += f\"Hypothetical option 2:\\n {item['rejected'][:1600]}\\n\\n\"\n    prompt += \"Is Option 1 better than Option 2? Yes or No.\"\n    prompt += \"&lt;|im_end|&gt;\\n\" + \"&lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant\\n\"\n    return prompt\nSide note: tokenizer.encode(\"Yes\") won’t give you the right token in this case, since “Yes” at the start of text or with a preceeding space != “Yes” following another character like the newline. Always check the topk probabilities from the model or decode some tokens to make sure you use the right one!\nAnyway, keeping those examples where the model agreed with the original label, I ended up with a smaller dataset I could use for the ‘filtered’ version. Training for the same number of steps on each, we see the score boost from 57.9 to 62.2 thanks to the filtering:\n\nScoring was done with alpaca_eval, using the ‘chatgpt_fn’ evaluator to save costs.This is just a quick initial test, but it aligns with my feeling that data quality is pretty important and that the existing datasets for fine-tuning and preference stuff might need a bit of cleanup!\nRelated Tweet: https://x.com/johnowhitaker/status/1732489803340673053?s=20"

It’s interesting for a few different reasons:\n1) Traffic incidents are rare - so rare the odds of one happening on a 500m stretch of road in a given hour (which is how Zindi has framed the problem) are always going to be low enough that ‘no incident’ is the most likely outcome. If the metric was accuracy, predicting all 0s would probably be your best bet. However, incidents do occur! And the chosen metric (F1 score) means that you’d better predict some incidents or you’ll score 0. More on this later.\n2) It’s spatial. We can treat this like any other supervised learning problem (with some data shaping) but these events are all located on a road grid that exists in the real world. Segments have positions, and lead into other segments. There are intersections, corners, different lanes…. Some GIS knowledge could give you an edge here (or you could wait for part 3!)\nSo, we need to create a model that can predict how likely it is that there will be an incident on a given stretch of road at a given time. Then we need to use that likelihood to choose some segments where we thing the chances of an incident are highest. And then we make submissions and hope we get a good score :) Where do we start?

How many sensors does one need to achieve a particular goal for resolution or performance? What geometries work best? And what if we can’t keep everything nice and regular? \n\nI built some tools that let me simulate these kinds of arrangements, and did some early experiments on image reconstruction and on the use of machine learning (specifically neural networks) to make sense of readings. Even with a weird arrangement like the one on the right, I could make some sense of the data. For more information on the simulation side, see the report in the GitHub repository.\nI tested out these arrangements in the real world by building some fixed arrangements, and by using a 3D printed scanner to position an LED and a phototransistor (PT from now on) in different locations to slowly simulate having many detectors and emitters. Using light as opposed to X-rays means cheap emitters and detectors, and of course much less danger.\n\nA ring of 8 LEDs and 8 PTs. Larger rings were also constructed, and the scanner could simulate arrangements of &gt;1000 sensors and emitters.\nBy taking a set of readings, we can start to estimate how much light travels along different paths, and thus build up an image of whatever is being scanned. This works well with lots of readings from the scanner:\n\nA reconstructed image of some small nails. The scanner could resolve objects less than 1mm in size.\nHowever, for arrangements with relatively few sensors (such as the static arrangement of 8 shown above), the reconstructed images are an apparently meaningless blur. The goal of this project was to use ML to make sense of these sets of readings, for example by identifying objects placed within the sensor ring or estimating their position."

Since I already had a simulator I had coded, why not try to use it to generate some fake training data?\nUsing purely simulated data resulted in some spectacularly bad results, but if a model was ‘primed’ with even a small real-world training dataset (say, 50 samples) then adding simulated data could improve the model and make it more robust. I’ll let the results speak for themselves:\n\nModel performance for position inference with and without simulated data for training\nThe simulator didn’t map to real life exactly, and no doubt could be improved to offer even more performance gains. But even as-is, it allows us to use far less training data to achieve the same result. Notice that a model trained on 150 samples does worse than one using only 50 samples but augmented with extra simulated data.

    "text": "It’s been nearly four months since my last post on this blog. I’d like to get back into writing things up here, but before putting up another normal post I figured it was worth giving a quick update on why things went quiet. Consider this less of a technical post and more of a personal update, and feel free to skip if you’re not interested :)\n\nExcuse #1 - Finding the balance when consulting is hard\nI’ve been working “full time” as a consultant for 18+ months now. For much of that I kept my hours fairly low, leaving plenty of time for personal research and other interests. I’m fortunate indeed to be able to live comfortably on fairly little - monthly expenses for my wife and I tally to something like 600 USD here in Zimbabwe [1]. However, work tends to arrive in batches and it’s always tempting to take on additional projects, especially if they’re interesting problems to work on.\nBy March, I had 5 ‘jobs’ ongoing, and was suddenly finding it hard to stay on track, especially with a global pandemic and local economic craziness adding their own wobbles. Thankfully I had supportive clients who were able to be slightly flexible - a lesson I’d share with anyone in this situation is to be very clear with everyone rather than trying to get it all figured out in secret. If you’re up front about difficulties, you can work out ways to minimize damage by pushing deadlines or working together to figure out what is most important to work on. I found that I had trouble focusing on anything without a near deadline, so I’d literally email clients and say “hey, as added motivation can we set an arbitrary deadline of Friday for this feature?” - this helped make sure I wasn’t just letting some projects slip through the cracks while focusing on the most urgent demands.\nSomehow I seem to have escaped with no harm done, but this has been a good warning about the danger of taking on too much. I still have a few months ahead that will be busier than I’d like, but I’m saying no to all sorts of things now. If I keep it up, I can start picking up threads like this blog, and I might even manage a vacation in September :)\n[1] - Fairly little by global Data Scientist standards. Many folks here live on less than a dollar a day, which is mind blowing.\n\n\nExcuse #2 - Outlets Abound\nSharing knowledge is somewhat addictive, which is why I started this blog in the first place. However, over the last few months I found that blog posts as a medium were simply too time-consuming to be a viable outlet for me. The didactic urge was instead satisfied by:\n\nStarter Notebooks. I like throwing up the quickest entry possible for data science competitions, and spending 10 minutes cleaning up the resulting notebook and sharing with the community is a very rewarding way to help fellow learners out and share knowledge. This also tends to lead to…\nEmails! I love getting emails from folks working on different problems. Most rewarding are those where it’s a problem I’ve encountered myself, and I can save somebody some major headaches by sharing the solution.\nTutorials for Zindi (it’s not time-consuming if it’s the employers time!). I’ve done a few posts for Zindi, such as “Climbing The Ladder” - a tutorial on leveling up in computer vision competitions. It’s fun to have a more targeted audience, and to share what I can with that great community.\nTeaching. I’m involved in a few online courses, which means creating lots of content for those classes (which might otherwise be turned into blog posts). As with emails, it reaches less people than publicly sharing something but it is super useful to those it does reach, which is rewarding in a different sort of way.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSo, there are my excuses for the lack of posts. I have a backlog of ideas and half-finished projects, so hopefully we’ll be back on schedule soon. As always, do let me know if you have any thoughts or questions on this post, or any requests for topics to cover :)"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nZindi has a competition running to identify individual turtles based on images from different views. This presents an interesting challenge for a few reasons:\n1) There are relatively few images per turtle (10-50 each) and these have been taken from multiple angles. Given how similar they are, simply treating this as a normal multi-class classification challenge is hard.\n2) There is an emphasis on generalization - it would be great if the organizations involved could add additional turtles without expensive re-training of models.\nOne potential approach that should help address these problems is to learn useful representations - some way to encode an image in a meaningful way such that the representations of images of one individual are all ‘similar’ by some measure while at the same time being dissimilar to the representations of images from other individuals. If we can pull this off, then given a new image we can encode it and compare the resulting representation with those of all known turtle images. This gives a ranked list of the most likely matches as well as a similarity score that could tell us if we’re looking at a completely new turtle.\nTo keep this post light on code, I have more info and a working example in this colab notebook. I’m also working on a video and will update this post once that’s done. And a modified version of this might be posted on Zindi learn, which again will be linked here once it’s up."

    "text": "Contrastive Learning\nThe goal of contrastive learning is to learn these useful representations in an unsupervised or loosely-supervised fashion (aka self-supervised learning). A typical approach is to take some images, create augmented versions of those images and then embed both the originals and the augmented versions with some encoder network. The objective is to maximise the similarity between an image and its augmented version while minimising the similarity between that image and all the rest of the images in the batch. The trick here is that augmentation is used to create two ‘versions’ of an image. In our turtle case, we also have pictures of the same individual from different angles which can be used in place of (or in addition to) image augmentations to get multiple versions depicting one individual.\n\nTop two rows: 16 turtles. Bottom 2 rows: augmented versions of different views of those same 16 turtles.\nIn my implementation, we generate a batch by picking batch_size turtles and then creating two sets of images with different pictures of those turtles. A resnet50 backbone acts like the encoder and is used to create embeddings of all of these images. We use a contrastive loss function to calculate a loss and update the network weights.\n\nThis is my first time using jax so there are probably more elegant ways to do this!\n\nMy post-it note with the formula\nMy attempt at a contrastive loss function\nYou can check the notebook or the video for more details on the implementation here. Once all the bugs were ironed out, the training loop runs and the loss shrinks nicely over time. But the question arises: how do we tell if the representations being learnt are actually useful?\nKey reference for going deeper: SimCLR - A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations"

If things are working well, we’ll feed the new image through our encoder model to get a representation and then compare that to the encoded representations of the known turtles. All pictures of a given individual should be ‘similar’ in this space, but should not be similar to images of other individuals. A neat way to visualize this is through something called a Representational Similarity matrix. We take, say, 16 images of 5 different turtles. We embed them all and compute all possible pair-wise similarities and then plot them as a heatmap:\n\nA Representation Similarity Matrix (RSM) comparing embeddings of 16 images from each of 5 turtles.\nThe images are obviously identical to themselves - hence the thin bright diagonal. But here you can also see that images of a given turtle seem to be similar to others of that same turtle - for instance, the bottom right 16x16 square shows that all images of the red turtle are quite similar to each other. This also shows us which turtles might be regularly confused (pink and yellow for eg) and which are relatively easy to disambiguate (pink and green).\nRSMs are a useful tool for quickly getting a feel for the kind of representations being learnt, and I think more people should use them to add visual feedback when working on this kind of model. Looking at RSMs for images in the training set vs a validation set, or for different views, can shed more light on how everything is working. Of course, they don’t tell the whole story and we should still do some other evaluations on a validation set."

This is pretty good considering we ignored the image_position label, the label balance and various flaws in the data! However, a classification-based baseline with FastAI scores ~0.6 and the top entries are shockingly close to perfect with mapk scores &gt;0.98 so we have a way to go before this is competitive.\nOne benefit of our approach: adding a new turtle to the database doesn’t require re-training.

Where do the positive tweeters live? Ideally, we’d account for different languages, grab a wide selection of tweets covering a longer timeline and do all sorts of other careful analyses. But since this entire project is the result of one night’s insomnia I just grabbed the latest 200 English tweets from each country’s capital (using the countryinfo library to get the coordinates) and went with those. Plotting the average sentiment as a choropleth map using Plotly gives us the title image of this post. Don’t read too much into this - it’s just a demo to show what might be possible with a bit more work."

    "section": "Pic The Best",
    "text": "Pic The Best\nLet’s start on images. Imagine you have two competing text-to-image systems. Both use an identical model, but when A generates an image it only shows you one sample, while B generates 4 and picks the best one. What percentage of the time will you prefer the image from B? 80% of the time! Newer models are lucky if they can brag about a 5% improvement in win-rate over the competition (see below) so an 80% win rate is huge. Now do the maths for a case where we generate 100 images and pick the best…\n\n\n\nImage model win rates from the Stable Diffusion 3 launch post, where a win-rate of a few percent is a big deal…\n\n\nOf course, there’s a catch. “The best one” in the previous paragraph assumed we have a way of picking in advance which of the four you’ll prefer. Imagine instead that B generates 4 images and returns one of the four at random. Now the win-rate is back to 50%. And worse, it takes 4x as long! So the only way our scheme has any legs is if we can somehow pick images in a way that at least roughly aligns with what humans (you’re a human right?) will prefer.\nOne useful measure is the CLIP similarity score between the image and the prompt, which tends to track well with how accurately the image represents the prompt. Another option is to use a model trained to predict human ratings or preferences - I’m a fan of PickScore which correlates well with aesthetics in my experience.\nTo play with these ideas, I wrote some code that ships off a prompt to ~5 different image generation APIs and generates a bunch of candidate images which are then scored with CLIP and PickScore to rank them. Here’s the best and worst image from my first test, for the prompt “An astronaut riding a horse on mars:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image with the highest CLIP score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the one with the lowest\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, how can we spend even more inference time compute to get this system to deliver even better results? We have big LLMs now that can do things like re-write the prompt, and since some are ‘multimodal’ we can also show them the results and use that to modify the prompt to fix any potential flaws. With this we’re moving from ‘generate N pick one’ to something more like the ‘flow engineering’ the cool kids like to talk about, creating multi-step processes that refine the result. Think about something like this:\nYour task is to evaluate whether the following image accurately follows the prompt.\nPrompt: {image_prompt}\nIf the image follows the prompt well, respond with 'yes'. \nIf not, suggest a better prompt...\nI added this to my pipeline, along with a pre-processing step that re-writes the prompt to get more variations and a final ranking step using model X to pick the final one. The results take a while but are pretty darn good! I ran it on 50 prompts from my ‘that should be a band-name’ list, you can see the results here TODO link. TODO random boting to get a win rate?"

I used this reward model (which itself is also a fine-tune of Llama 3 8B, making this something we could reasonably imigine being a lightweigt adapter) to score the candidate completions.

With LLM-judged leaderboards like this we must always be cautions translating scores to true performance… Which brings up a good, more general question: how should we rank/score outputs if we want to bring this same approach to bear on other text generation tasks? And how can we improve on the simple ‘best of N’ approach?\n\n\n\n‘X’ of thought: different approaches to using more inference compute before commiting to a final answer\n\n\nThe literature around this topic is filling up with approaches, some of which are illustrated in the figure above. There’s ‘Chain of Thought’ where we ask the model to produce some intermediate reasoning steps before its final answer, ‘Tree of Thought’ which constructs a tree of possible completions, along with tons of variations that cajole different models into debates with eachother, introduce ‘backtracking’ to try and correct mistakes partway through, and so on. A good example of a complex flow tuned to a specific system was this one I found recently looking at ways to boost performance on coding tasks:\n\n\n\nAlphacodium’s proposed flow\n\n\nThese flow-based approaches might not make sense just yet, when it feels like a bigger model might come along and do the tasks better without any tricks or that latency matters… But anyone who has tried the 800 tokens/second Grok demos or the real-time image generation demos kows, we’re getting better at making things go fast! And as anyone who’s spent time with even the best models knows, there is still a lot that these things can’t reliably do. So I suspect we will see more and more cases where it makes sense to spend a bit more inference compute to get a better result. I hope this blog post has you thinking of some ways you might be able to do that :)"

The data already contains these environmental variables - I highly encourage you to try your own plots, or to read up the more thorough analyses in [1].\n\n\nComparing Countries\nThere are many ways we could compare countries. A bar plot of average economic activity per grid cell, perhaps, or comparison between the most productive single grid cell in each country. I was interested to see which countries had the most spread. The GIF below shows this dramatically: the top few cells in Russia are responsible for a huge chunk of the economic activity, while India has much more of a spread:\n\nScaled fraction of the total economic activity in four countries.\nFor the code, see the GitHub repository associated with this post."

If we just sample a random 5-second clip from a full recording, we might end up with a clip in which the bird is not calling - not ideal! To get around this, we compute a sort of signal-to-noise measure (in this case, PCEN-based SNR as used by the BirdVox project). With this, we can choose ‘peaks’ where the calls are most prominent.\n\nIdentifying ‘peaks’ with a high PCEN-based SNR\nThe code for this is in my first notebook. For each train file, we store the location of 20 peaks in a csv file which we will than use during training to select the appropriate clips."

Some models can handle this, but in most cases a better approach is to find a more compressed representation of the sound. In this case I chose a fairly standard approach: the mel spectrogram. A spectrogram looks like a 2D image, with time on the X axis, frequency on the y axis and intensity represented by colour.\n\nAn example spectrogram\nThe model training notebook shows how we set up the dataloaders to read in a specified clip and turn it into a spectrogram that can be fed to the model. This is quite CPU-heavy, which does slow the training down. But I still chose this approach over pre-computing the spectrograms once at the start because it allows for data augmentation such as shifting the window, adding noise etc on the raw audio before it gets converted to a spectrogram.\n\nYou can see all the code in the baseline model notebook. Taking inspiration from the pets tutorial, we create our own custom Transform that handles ‘encoding’ a given clip/label pair, which in turn is used to create our DataLoaders. By adding a ‘decodes’ method we also enable functionality such as ‘show_batch()’."

This can eat up GPU time, so I have started running my interactive tests with small subsets of the data and then relying on the run triggered by a save to actually do the full training.\nBecause this is then running ‘in the background’, saving any info you need is a must. I use the CSVLogger callback to save the stats after each epoch, and do other things like saving loss plots as pngs. Finally, we save the model itself for future use.\nWith this small model and CPU heavy dataloader, running on CPU was only a couple of times slower than on GPU. Wih a bit of patience, one could simply run this overnight rather than using up your weekly GPU quota, saving the GPU goodness for fast iteration when experimenting. In fact after the save failed a few times I ended up switching off the GPU and letting it train on the CPU over 7 or 8 hours.\n\nAgain, full code is in the notebook. After 3 epochs (the number of epochs and the learning rate chosen somewhat arbitrarily) we get to an accuracy of ~53% - impressive given the large number of classes. I’m sure a better model and more training would boost this, but that is something we can play with later…"

We would assume a better accuracy in our simplified case will mean a better model, but ideally we want a way to evaluate our model in a setting that is as close as possible to the final task.\nFortunately, the competition hosts have provided some labelled audio recordings that match the format of the test set. We can use this in our evaluation notebook to simulate a submission. Our model needs to provide a list of all bird species calling in a given 5-second clip. The way we will approach this for now is to take the model’s output probabilities and pick some threshold above which we will include a given species.\nIn the future, we will want to take geographic location into account, as well as ideally training a model directly on this kind of multi-label task. Even without this, our very simple model gets and F1-score of about 0.64 on the provided evaluation set and a leaderboard score of 0.55.

To make things interesting, the datasets I’ll be using will be from Zindi competitions, letting us see where AutoML would rank on the player leader-board.

You give it a dataset to work on, specify column types, choose an output column and specify how long you’d like it to train for (you pay per hour). Then sit back and wait. Behind the scenes, AutoML tries many different models and slowly optimizes network architecture, parameters, weights… essentially everything one could possibly tweak to improve performance gets tweaked. At the end of it, you get a (very complicated) model that you can then deploy with their services or use to make batch predictions.\n\nThe first step with AutoML tables - Importing the data.\nThe resultant models are fairly complex (mine were ~1GB each fully trained) and are not something you can simply download and use locally - you must deploy them via Google (for an extra fee). This, coupled with the cost of training models, makes it fairly expensive to experiment with if you use up your trial credits - so use them wisely.\nFortunately, there are other ways to achieve broadly the same result. For example, AutoKeras. Read more about that here."

This done, I uploaded the resultant training file to cloud storage, selected the table, chose my input and output columns and hit go.\n\nAutoML ‘Evaluate’ tab showing model performance.\nThe scoring metric for this competition is log loss.

I uploaded the test set, hit predict and then manually cleaned up the output to match the submission format for Zindi. Score? 0.546, putting me in 12th place. No feature engineering besides sampling some satellite images, no manual tweaking of model parameters…. not bad!\nI was quite pleased with this result. I enjoy the feature engineering side of things, but the tedium of hyper-parameter tuning is less appealing to me. If this tool can magically let me skip that step, it’s a win in my book! I may re-visit this with some added features, information from more images and perhaps a trick or two to enlarge the training set."

I hastily uploaded the predictions to Zindi, to see the score of… 5.3 (160th place). Now, I might be missing some glaring error in the way I formatted predictions for upload, but I suspect that the issue is with AutoML. It’s not really designed for such small datasets. From the website: “Depending on how many features your dataset has, 1,000 rows might not be enough to train a high-performing model.” The impressive MAE shown in the results tab is for one particular test set, and it seems that for the Zindi test set we were simply not as lucky. Another potential factor: The random test set will have sampled from the same date range as the training data, whereas the Zindi test set was for a different time period. In cases like this, a non-shuffled test/train split can be a better indicator of true performance.\nSo, we’ve learnt something new! The magic tool isn’t magic, and just like any other method it needs good training data to make good predictions."

But on the Uber Movement site, you can specify a start and end location and get up to three months of daily average travel times. This is what we’ll be using.\n\n\n\n\nUsing sophisticated mapping software (see above), I planned 7 routes that would cover most of the road segments. For each route, I chose a start and end zone in the Uber Movement interface (see table above) and then I downloaded the data. To do it manually would have taken ages, and I’m lazy, so I automated the process using pyautogui, but you could also just resign yourself to a few hours of clicking away and get everything you need. More routes here would have meant better data, but this seemed enough to give me a rough traffic proxy.\n\nSome of the travel times data\nI manually tagged each segment with the equivalent Uber Movement trip I would be using to quantify traffic in that area, using QGIS.

    "section": "Part 1: Why LLMs are exciting",
    "text": "Part 1: Why LLMs are exciting\nThe TL;DR of this section is that it turns out there is a lot of innovation happening in this space, and lots of low-hanging fruit available in terms of improvements to be made, all driven by open-source models and the influx of new ideas. For a while, it felt like you needed to be at a big org with tons of compute to research LLM stuff and that OpenAI was just too far ahead for most things. Here are some specific thoughts I wrote out the other day when someone asked what I found exciting:\nThe explosion of interest in LLMs has led to a flurry of innovations around them. In particular, there are some cool techniques around lower-resource training and inference that I’m excited to see:\n- Quantization methods to reduce the VRAM required to train and serve larger models\n- Things like GGML for fast inference without any dependencies, optimized for things like Apple hardware and consumer GPUs (see Modular for a direction in which inference gets easy and fast on lots of different hardware)\n- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that allow training with much less compute. It’s tricky to fine-tune the smallest GPT-2 model (125M parameters) on Google Colab when not using any tricks, and yet there are notebooks for SFT on Falcon 7B that can be run happily on the free tier thanks to LoRA and 8-bit Adam.\nThe upshot of all this is that it’s now doable to train variants of these fairly powerful open-source models with a single GPU in very little time and to share the resulting models (or the much smaller LoRA weights) through things like HuggingFace so that anyone can play with them. \nI think the next direction where things will rapidly improve is datasets for fine-tuning. We’ve already seen a big leap in quality over the past few months, with more and more chat / instruct datasets being curated. An obvious next step is using existing LLMs to generate better training data, and/or filter existing data. \nThe evaluation is lagging a little IMO. The open LLM leaderboard is a cool initiative, although it highlights how fragile these benchmarks can be. I’m excited about using LLMs to evaluate other LLMs (even though this can be precarious) and also hoping to see other alternatives emerge - perhaps something equivalent to the PickScore model that is a useful tool for evaluating image generators and is based on crowd-sourced ratings. Actual human ratings are still super important and hard to do well.\nAnother fun dynamic is just the constant stream of better base models available for fine-tuning as people compete to make ‘The BEST Truly Open Source Model’. Better base models mean better synthetic data, easier fine-tuning, more use-cases unlocked, more data as a result… it’s a nice flywheel of improvement. And since fine-tuning is getting faster and faster, when a great new base model comes out it won’t take long to apply the same dataset+training strategy as you’ve used on whatever current best model you have. \nIt feels like all these things make it easier than ever to do cool stuff with LLMs, but also that there are a lot of improvements still on the table - a good time to dive in!\nPS: Other interesting directions:\n\nWays to use multiple models of different sizes to speed up inference for ‘easy’ completions without sacrificing accuracy\nMoving away from RLHF towards something more like Direct Policy Optimization where you still incorporate feedback but without the RL messiness\nI still think very few people have good recipes for fine-tuning models and getting to know a specific model/task well would likely yield some interesting insights\n\nIt’s important to be able to iterate quickly for research to be effective, and when testing an idea meant training an LLM for weeks on tons of GPUs I was not excited. But now that we can potentially tune a good open-source base model on a single machine it seems like we might be close to rapid iterations especially if we just focus on the fine-tuning/alignment/tweaking steps or inference-time innovations. “LLMs are having their Stable Diffusion moment”."

This leads us to look into some prior work (e.g. the TinyStories paper by some of the same authors that tested similar ideas at a smaller scale) which in turn cites other papers which… Before you know it we have a Zotero library with 300+ papers and some ongoing experiments to start building our own intuition for some of the methods we found interesting.\nSome specific things I find extremely powerful about this group-study approach:\n\nTeaching others about something is an extremely good way to learn it, especially if your audience consists of people who can come up with questions to probe deeper and expand your collective understanding\nMore people =&gt; more chance for ‘aha’ moments where something suddenly clicks, which can then be explained back in a different way. It seems crazy, but we’ve bootstrapped our understanding of some extremely complex topics just by explaining an idea back and forth to each other in different ways until it really makes sense!\nMore people =&gt; more perspectives with different experiences to draw from. Someone shares a paper on document retrieval, which sparks a memory of a cool contrastive method used in images, which reminds someone of a paper aligning code and language from a few years ago, which brings up a nice benchmark we could use to test our new ideas…\nPractical experiments are great learning tools. Having multiple people tinkering with things or sharing proof-of-concept implementations is another major boost to understanding something.\n\nIt’s one thing to load up your brain with tons of papers and techniques, but that on its own isn’t quite enough to make you useful. So, for me, the next step is getting into the weeds with some actual projects. Run some models, try to train a few on some different tasks, dive into some larger projects… A lot of what I’ve done in this phase isn’t particularly new or interesting, but it builds the muscles for later stuff. If you’re bold you could find a way to get paid for this as a consultant, since everyone wants ‘talk to your docs’ bots and such! I have yet to cave in to that particular temptation, but I *AM* writing a book with some chapters devoted to LLMs (with some amazing co-authors to catch any glaring mistakes I make) which I guess is also killing two birds with one stone in terms of learning while (eventually, hypothetically) earning… And soon I may be full-time at the aforementioned LLM-based startup at which point it stops being ‘hacking around in my spare time’ and turns into ‘ML research’ with a proper job title and everything :)"

    "text": "A 3D model of a protein kinase\nWe recently hosted a Zindi hackathon in partnership with Instadeep that challenged participants to predict the functional class of protein kinases (enzymes with some very specific functions in the cell) based on nothing but their amino acid sequences. This kind of sequence classification task has lots of potential applications - there is a lot of un-labelled data lying around on every computational biologist’s computer, and a tool that could guess a given protein’s function would be mighty handy.\nJust one problem - it’s not exactly a simple task! There are 20-something amino acids which we represent as letters. Given a sequence like ‘AGASGSUFOFBEASASSSSSASBBBDGDBA’ (frantically monkey-types for emphasis) we need to find a way to a) encode this as something a model can make sense of and b) do the making-sense-of-ing! Fortunately, there’s another field where we need to go from a string of letters to something meaningful: Natural Language Processing. Since I’d just been watching the NLP lesson in the latest amazing fastai course I felt obliged to try out the techniques Jeremy was talking about on this sequence classification task."

    "text": "The Basic Approach\n\nTokenized input (left) and class (right)\nTreating this as a language task and drawing inspiration from ULMFiT[1], this was my basic approach:\n\nI tokenized the sequences using ‘subword tokenization’ which captures not just individual amino acids as tokens but common groupings as well (eg ‘EELR’ is encoded as a single token). I think this basic approach was suggested by the SentencePiece paper[4] and it’s now part of fastai[5].\nI then created a ‘pretext task’ of sequence completion to train a ‘language model’ (based on the AWD-LSTM architecture[2]). The model learns to predict the next token in a sequence with ~32% accuracy - the hope is that in doing so it also learns useful embeddings and some sort of latent understanding of how these sequences are structured.\nWe keep most of this network as the ‘encoder’ but modify the final layers for the actual task: sequence classification. Thanks to the pre-training, the model can very quickly learn the new task. I can get to 98% accuracy in a couple of minutes by training on only a small subset of the data.\nTraining the model for the sequence classification task takes a while on the full competition dataset, but it eventually reaches 99.8% accuracy with a log_loss on the test set (as used in the competition) of 0.08, which is equivalent to 3rd place.\nDoing the normal tricks of ensembling, training a second model on reversed sequences etc quite easily bumps this up to glory territory, but that’s the boring bit.\n\nIt was fun to see how well this worked. You can find a more detailed write-up of the initial experiments on that competition dataset here. Spurred by these early results, I figured it was worth looking into this a little more deeply. What have others been doing on this task? Is this approach any good compared to the SOTA? Has anyone tried this particular flow on this kind of problem?"

    "text": "Getting Formal\nIt should come as no surprise that the idea of treating sequence classification like a language modelling task has already occurred to some people. For example, USDMProt[7] turns out to have very nearly the same approach as that outlines above (self-five!). Their github is a great resource.\nThere are other approaches as well - for example, ProtCNN[6] and DEEPPred[8] propose their own deep learning architectures to solve these kinds of tasks. And there are some older approaches such as BLAST and it’s derivatives[9] that have long been standards in this field which still do decently (although they seem to be getting out-performed by these newer techniques).\nSo, we’re not the first to try this. However, I couldn’t find any papers using anything like the ‘subword’ tokenization. They either use individual amino acids as tokens, or in rare cases some choice of n-grams (for example, triplets of amino acids). The advantage of subword tokenization over these is that it can scale between the complexity of single-acid encodings and massive n-gram approaches by simply adjusting the vocabulary size."

If you’re looking for a fun NLP challenge with the potential to turn into some interesting research, this could be the job for you! Here’s my suggestions:\n\nPick one or more benchmarks. Classification of the PFam dataset is a nice one to start with. The ProtCNN paper[6] (quick link) has done a bunch of the ‘standard’ algorithms and shared their split as a kaggle dataset, so you can quickly compare to those results.\nGet some data for language model training. The SWISSProt dataset is a nice one, and for early tests even just the PFam dataset is enough to try things out.\nTrain some language models. Do single-acid tokenization as a baseline and then try subword tokenization with a few different vocab sizes to compare.\nSee which models do best on the downstream classification task. Lots of experimenting to be done on sequence length, training regime and so on.\nFor bonus points, throw a transformer model or two at this kind of problem. I bet they’d be great, especially if pre-trained on a nice big dataset.\nIf (as I suspect) one of these does very well, document your findings, try everything again in case it was luck and publish it as a blog or, if you’re a masochist, a paper.\n… profit?\n\nI really hope someone reading this has the motivation to give this a go. If nothing else it’s a great learning project for language modelling and diving into a new domain. Please let me know if you’re interested - I’d love to chat, share ideas and send you the things I have tried. Good luck :)"

    "text": "This Christmas, I was introduced to several new games by my new extended family. Much fun was had making up new games and rediscovering old, but one game annoyed me slightly. A dice game that involved rolling handfuls of dice for different scores and racing to 10000 points - known to the family as ‘Farkle’ but with rules that made it closer to ‘Dice 10000’, also called ‘Zilch’. What bothered me was the fact that, despite much talk of techniques and riskiness, most players tended to follow the same basic strategy, leaving the outcome to chance. As you’ll see, the rules are just complex enough that basic stats thinking / human intuition aren’t always able to give a quick answer as to which choice is best. Anyway, having lost badly on Christmas Day I went home, thought about it for a bit and then spent an hour or two on Boxing Day coding a simulator to test some of my hypotheses. This post documents my experiments.\nHere is a basic description of the rules, adapted from http://zilch.playr.co.uk/rules.php"

    "text": "Risky play as an advantage\nI tried some other random changes, but at this point, the best average score seemed to be around 808, re-rolling with three dice if score &lt; 500 and only keeping 5s when necessary. But, as mentioned earlier, I had a suspicion that risky play might work out when playing with larger numbers of players.\nLet’s examine just one type of risky play to investigate this. When 5 scoring dice are rolled, a player may choose to roll the single remaining dice. Since the only ways to score with one dice are 1 and 5, there is a 33% chance of success. But success means another roll with all six dice, and potentially even higher scores! So, the player is taking a chance in order to get a higher score 1/3 of the time.\nI coded up a player with this behaviour. It includes a threshold - for scores over this threshold, it won’t risk it (neither would you). Initially, this threshold was set at 500. Since it’s relatively rare to get less than 500 points while using all but one dice, the risky play doesn’t hurt the average score much - it drops to ~806. But this is where things get interesting: with three players (one baseline, one playing the best strategy found so far and one playing with this added risky behaviour), the risky player wins slightly less games then the top ‘best’ player. As one might expect given the slightly lower score. But the difference in win percentage is only 0.5%. And when we add more players, a different result emerges.\nWith 6 players playing the ‘best’ strategy and one taking risks (risking a single dice roll with scores &lt; 700), the risky player still has a lower average score (only 803) BUT it wins more than 1/7 of the time. In other words, the risky behaviour pays off in larger groups. Here are the total wins after each player has had 3 million turns:\nwins = {‘dump5s1’: 65559, ‘dump5s2’: 64978, ‘dump5s3’: 65293, ‘dump5s4’: 65080, ‘dump5s5’: 65238, ‘dump5s6’: 65160, ‘risks1’: 66318}\nAnd the average scores:\ndump5s1 807.679317\ndump5s2 806.118700\ndump5s3 806.327633\ndump5s4 806.029383\ndump5s5 806.765667\ndump5s6 807.170067\nrisks1 802.735333\nSo, a strategy that wins in two-player mode (dump5s1 beats risks1 50.4% of the time) might not be best in larger groups."

    "text": "This ‘Data Glimpse’ post will look at the Global Radiance-Calibrated Nighttime Lights dataset [1], available through Google Earth Engine. However, the method shown here can be used with any Raster data source. To avoid repetition, I’ll refer back to this post any time I aggregate raster data over a shapefile.\n\nThe Data\nThe dataset is a collection of images from different years showing nighttime lights all over the globe. This information can be used to see where people are [2] and estimate measures such as economic activity in an area [3]. They have been used in some great research estimating the Global Human Footprint and highlighting the last wild places on earth [4].\n\nNighttime lights displayed in GEE\nEach image contains two bands: ‘avg_vis’, which is the measure of illumination, and ‘cf_cvg’ describing cloud cover (used as a data quality metric).\n\n\nAggregating the Data by Region\nInstead of a large raster image, we might want to aggregate the data by region. For example, we might want to look at how the amount of light visible at night in National Parks has changed over time. To get the data in the form that we want, we first need to define the regions that we’re interested in. This script that I made to illustrate the idea uses a landuse map of Zimbabwe as an example, but one could just as easily use Country outlines or draw a region with the ‘Draw a shape’ tool in GEE.\nWith the input region(s) defined, the key step is to use the reduceRegions function to add properties to each feature (area) that summarize the underlying raster. For example, with an image of nighttime illumination in the year 2000 called ‘lights_2000’ and the landuses map, we can add the mean illumination in each area with var landuse_with_lights = lights_2000.reduceRegions(landuses, ee.Reducer.mean());. The result can be exported as a shapefile or CSV file (see the script for details) and displayed or analyses in whatever software you like.\n\nAverage nighttime illumination over Zimbabwe\n\n\nChange over Time\nOne of the nice things about this dataset is that it contains values for several different years. I took a look at the data from 2000 and 2010, with the goal of seeing if protected areas (forest lands, national parks etc) had seen an increase in nighttime lights (an indicator that people are moving into these areas). Most protected areas in Zimbabwe had almost no nighttime lights recorded, and those that did show (on average) a drop in the amount of nighttime lights (2010 values are ~20% lower than those for 2000). In the few places where lights had increased, the increase seems to be due to safari camps rather than encroachment from neighboring districts. The data can’t tell the whole story, and poor coverage plus the relative dimness of firelight might mean that some encroachment is missed, but it was encouraging to see that the wilderness areas are still largely dark and empty - just the way they should be.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] - https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_DMSP-OLS_CALIBRATED_LIGHTS_V4\n[2] - Elvidge, C.D., Imhoff, M.L., Baugh, K.E., Hobson, V.R., Nelson, I., Safran, J., Dietz, J.B. and Tuttle, B.T., 2001.

For now, let me present my first attempt:\n\n‘Bridge over Rainbow Water’ - J Whitaker, 2019\nThis is made with a technique called Style Transfer. For more information and an easy way to try it out yourself, see the example on Google Colab. The general idea is to use a neural network to generate images that are similar to a ‘content image’ but that have the style of a separate ‘style image’. The way the style difference is quantified is by using a network trained for image recognition - the early layers in these networks tend to measure style attributes.\nNow for the specifics of this piece:\n- The general practice is to start from the content image, and slowly morph to an image that stylistically matches the style image. I turned this around, beginning with the style image and watching the structure slowly emerge.\n- I tweaked the learning rate and other parameters, trying to maintain the curving, flowing nature of the style image even as the straight lines of the bridge come forward.\n- Most styles are picked from famous artists. Since this is a co-creation with my laptop, the style image is a microscope image of my screen, which was itself displaying the microscope feed. The screen’s sub-pixels are the source of the rainbow colours.\nSome attempts that didn’t make the cut:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might suspect, I’ve been playing with introducing distortion into the process. Just as we perceive a work in progress through the lens of our eyes (from different angles, with non-uniform lighting), I’d like the algorithm to only see a distorted view of it’s output. This could be a blur or transform, but ultimately I’d like to try using a webcam and some wavy glass to create a means of perception for my co-artist.\nStay tuned for more attempts at music and art!"

    "text": "TIL: Intercepting Github Copilot with MITMProxy\nWe’ve been messing with integrating AI into notebook coding, and got curious about how Github Copilot structures the context it uses to generate code when called from a notebook.\nTo see what it’s sending, I set up mitmproxy (https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-getting-started/) and had to set the proxy and uncheck Proxy Strict SSL in VSC to start capturing things:\n\nNow any time you trigger Copilot, you can see the request in mitmproxy. There’s a few ways Copilot can be triggered. One is the ‘completions’ mode that provides inline suggestions as you type. The requests for this have the immediate context: the prefix and the suffix (in this case the suffix is empty). Here’s an example:\n{\"prompt\":\"#!/usr/bin/env python3\\n# generated with chatgpt\\n\\nimport googlemaps\\nimport math\\nfrom random import uniform\\n\\ndef generate_random_coordinates(lat, lon, max_distance_km):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate a random point within a circular area defined by max_distance_km.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # Random angle\\n    theta = uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)\\n    # Random radius, weighted by area\\n    r = max_distance_km * math.sqrt(uniform(0, 1))\\n    # Convert polar to cartesian\\n    dx = r * math.cos(theta)\\n    dy = r * math.sin(theta)\\n\\n    # Earth's radius in kilometers\\n    earth_radius = 6371\\n    # New latitude in degrees\\n    new_lat = lat + (dy / earth_radius) * (180 / math.pi)\\n    # New longitude in degrees, taking into account the latitude compression\\n    new_lon = lon + (dx / earth_radius) * (180 / math.pi) / math.cos(lat * math.pi/180)\\n    return new_lat, new_lon\\n\\ndef create_route_link(start_location, distance_km, api_key):\\n    gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=api_key)\\n    initial_location = gmaps.geocode(start_location)[0]['geometry']['location']\\n    lat, lon = initial_location['lat'], initial_location['lng']\\n\\n    # Determine the number of segments; aiming to use about 10 waypoints\\n    num_segments = 10\\n    segment_length = (distance_km / 2) / num_segments  # Half the route outwards\\n    waypoints = []\\n    current_lat, current_lon = lat, lon\\n\\n    # Generate waypoints\\n    for _ in range(num_segments):\\n        new_lat, new_lon = generate_random_coordinates(current_lat, current_lon, segment_length)\\n        waypoints.append((new_lat, new_lon))\\n        current_lat, current_lon = new_lat, new_lon\\n\\n    # Generate the return route directly without additional waypoints to avoid the limit\\n    directions_result = gmaps.directions((lat, lon),\\n                                         (lat, lon),\\n                                         mode=\\\"walking\\\",\\n                                         waypoints=[(lat, lon) for lat, lon in waypoints],\\n                                         optimize_waypoints=True)\\n\\n    # Construct Google Maps link for the route\\n    start = f\\\"{lat},{lon}\\\"\\n    waypoints_param = '|'.join(f\\\"{lat},{lon}\\\" for lat, lon in waypoints)\\n    return f\\\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin={start}&destination={start}&waypoints={waypoints_param}&travelmode=walking\\\"\\n\\n### Solara code - not AI generated\\nimport os\\nimport solara\\nimport solara.lab\\n\\nGOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = os.environ.get(\\\"GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY\\\", \\\"AIzaSyBC-xxx\\\")\\nassert GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, \\\"Please set a key\\\"\\n\\nstart_location = solara.reactive(\\\"Groningen, Netherlands\\\")\\ndesired_distance_km = solara.reactive(10.0)\\n\\n\\n@solara.lab.task\\ndef generate_route():\\n    return create_route_link(start_location.value, desired_distance_km.value, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)\\n\\n\\n@solara.component\\ndef TrailGeneratorApp():\\n    solara.InputText(\\\"Start location\\\", start_location)\\n    solara.InputFloat(\\\"Desired distance (km)\\\", desired_distance_km)\\n    solara.Button(\\\"Generate route\\\", on_click=generate_route, icon_name=\\\"mdi-google-maps\\\", color=\\\"primary\\\")\\n    solara.ProgressLinear(generate_route.pending)\\n    if generate_route.error:\\n        solara.Error(repr(generate_route.exception))\\n    if generate_route.value:\\n        solara.Button(label=\\\"View route\\\", href=generate_route.value, target=\\\"_blank\\\", icon_name=\\\"mdi-walk\\\",\\n                      outlined=True, color=\\\"primary\\\")\\nTrailGeneratorApp()        \\n\\n# COmment triggering a completion\",\"suffix\":\"\",\"max_tokens\":500,\"temperature\":0,\"top_p\":1,\"n\":1,\"stop\":[\"\\n\"],\"nwo\":\"AnswerDotAI/johno_research\",\"stream\":true,\"extra\":{\"language\":\"python\",\"next_indent\":0,\"trim_by_indentation\":true,\"prompt_tokens\":782,\"suffix_tokens\":0}}\nYou can also explicitly invoke the assistant with Ctrl-I, which opens up a dedicated prompt UI.

There’s another writeup on this here with more info.\n\n\n\ncursor flows captured with mitmproxy\n\n\nI tried this same approach using Cursor. Unlike copilot it doesn’t send a single request with all the context, instead sending frequent updates, re-ranking available bits of context, and letting you explicitly tag in files, functions, docs (which can be added as retrieval sources). Very fancy, a lot harder to make sense of from the requests alone, and opaque in terms of what the final prompt etc looks like."

    "text": "I’m a big fan of the idea of Sharing Scrappy Fiddles.\nI’m always trying to do this more - sharing WIPs on X, writing up TILs on our internal blog for my colleagues, keeping up this blog…\nOne new category of things I haven’t know how/where to share are bits of ephemeral software I make with LLMs. Specifically Claude’s artifacts tool - it makes it easy to whip up a fun little web app for all sorts of things, but has no easy ‘share’ button to spread that around. It’s strange since I feel less ownership of these tools, but they do often involve a fair amount of back and forth. And I’ve noticed that if I DO deploy them (this post will show you how) I often end up tweaking them more and feeling like they’re really mine, as opposed to playing with the v1 for a sec and disguarding it.\nAnthropic has some specific libraries and a build process that I hadn’t seen documented for Artifacts, so for any that weren’t plain HTML+vanilla JS, I had thought it would be very involved to get a locally-running version. Thankfully, SImon Willison’s [fantastic post] led me to this tool: claude-artifact-runner by Claudio Silva. You can copy the artifact code into a file (artifact-component.tsx), run the build command (npx vite build IIRC) and then you have a dist/ folder with the built artifact. Once there, you can host this in a variety of ways. I have mine set up with a little FastHTML site (source) since I plan to add other tools in the near future. This is running on a Nanode 1 GB from Linode - $5/month. Fun, and not too bad to set up, not a great option if you don’t want to go down the rabbit hole of setting up a server.\n\n\n\ntools site\n\n\nAn easier option is to take the built artifact and pop it into a github repository. Here’s an example. As long as there’s an index.html file in the route you can open up the “Pages” section of the repo settings and tell it to build from the main branch. This will give you a github pages site like https://johnowhitaker.github.io/minisynth/ that you can share with anyone. It’s free and easy, and you can pop the artifact source code in there too to have a reference for yourself or others.\nOf course, neither of these options are seamless, and there’s a lot of room for improvement. I like the look of GitHub Sparks, which are easy-to-create apps with some kind of DB for storage and trivial to share. Replit’s Agents make things you can deploy and share on there too, but aren’t free. And Val.town has their ‘Townie’ bot that also suits some kinds of software.\nThese little one-shot mini apps aren’t always great, but when you need something constrained and specific I think it’s magical that you can conjure it up with a short conversation. And now, hopefully, you can see how to share it easily too.\nPS: Here’s how I add a bunch of static artifacts to their own routes on tools.johnowhitaker.com in FastHTML:\nstatic_apps_dir = Path(__file__).parent / \"static_apps\"\nprint(static_apps_dir)\nfor path in static_apps_dir.glob(\"*\"):\n    if path.is_dir():\n        app_name = path.name\n        print(f\"Adding route: /{app_name}\")\n        @app.get(f'/{app_name}')\n        def serve_index(app_name: str = app_name):\n            return FileResponse(static_apps_dir / app_name / 'index.html')\n        \n        for asset in (path/'assets').glob(\"*\"):\n            asset_name = asset.name\n            print(f\"Adding asset: {app_name}/{asset_name}\")\n            @app.get(f'/assets/{app_name}/{asset_name}')\n            def serve_asset(asset_name: str = asset_name, app_name: str = app_name):\n                return FileResponse(static_apps_dir / app_name / 'assets' / asset_name)\n            \n        # Modify the index.html to use the asset path with the app name\n        index_html = (static_apps_dir / app_name / 'index.html').read_text()\n        index_html = index_html.replace('src=\"/assets/index', f'src=\"/assets/{app_name}/index')\n        index_html = index_html.replace('href=\"/assets/index', f'href=\"/assets/{app_name}/index')\n        (static_apps_dir / app_name / 'index.html').write_text(index_html)\nThis means I can simply add the latest new artifact to the static_apps folder and it will be served at tools.johnowhitaker.com/artifact_name. Almost painless :) I might feature one or two more soon, there’s one that started as a quick demo and is turning into a very fun tool."

The 5x5 case takes less than a second and the 6x6 takes a few minutes. So 8x8 will likely take a while.

You make a channel, then Edit Channel (top of channel) -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Webhooks -&gt; New Webhook. This gives you a URL like https://discord.com/api/webhooks/lasiufhaliufhla\nThen in your code you can use curl to send a message to that channel like so:\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d \"{\\\"content\\\": \\\"$total\\\"}\" \"$WEBHOOK_URL\"\nWhere $total is the message you want to send and $WEBHOOK_URL is the URL you got from discord.

Link: https://tools.johnowhitaker.com/audio_viz\nBoth these tools came together in under an hour, between 4pm and 5pm which is usually the dead zone where I’d done being productive work-wise and waiting for my beloved wife to get home. Each took a bit of back-and-forth to get right, but also didn’t need me to write much if any code. There’s a joy in crafting perfect software, but there’s also a joy in spontaneously bringing little things like this to life with just a bit of chatting with AI. What a time to be alive!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "One gripe I’ve had with digital instruments is a lack of expression. Coming from a wind instrument background, I don’t like having no control over a note once it starts. So I love the Roli Seaboard (I have the Rise 2) - a squishy playing surface that uses ‘Midi Polyphonic Expression’ (MPE) to let you vary all sorts of parameters by pushing, sliding, and squishing the keys. Unfortunately that’s a $1000+ investment, not so easy to recommend. Recently they announced a new product, that lets you control sound dynamics by waving your hands about above the keyboard, using hand tracking with a pair of IR cameras. Very cool! But as soon as I saw it the question becomes: can we get most of this for free with a webcam?\n‘Facewave’ is a proof-of-concept to show the answer is yes! I use mediaPipe to track face and hands in the shot, and send midi control codes (CC) out to be used in your synth of choice. Here’s what it looks like in action:\n\nThe code is available on GitHub and is hosted both on the accompanying github page (https://johnowhitaker.github.io/facewave/) and on my site (https://tools.johnowhitaker.com/facewave). You’ll need a way to feed the midi from that into a synth - I use loopmidi to create a virtual midi port that I can connect to my DAW. Here is a video of an early prototype in action.\nThis is a ton of fun! I made a simple synth tool to test this out if you don’t have a DAW / synth installed - you can play notes with your computer keyboard and modulate the sound with Facewave (as long as you have loopmidi set up).\nI love this idea, but don’t know how much further I’ll take it. I’d love someone with more musical contacts to share it around, or steal this idea and add it to your own tools!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "How well can LLMs estimate length?\nWhile discussing another paper based around ‘LLM-as-a-judge’ style evaluation, the topic of length bias (longer responses tend to be rated higher) came up. This prompted Jeremy to ask ‘Can LLMs even estimate the length of a sequence? How well?’. So I did a few quick tests to find out, and spotted a few interesting things along the way.\nFirst experiment: throwing some sequences through gpt-3.5-Turbo and gpt-4, using function calling to get a formatted response with a prompt like\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Estimate the length (in words) of the passage provided by the user.\"})\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Passage:\\n {'hi'*30}\"})\nchat_response = chat_completion_request(\n    messages, tools=tools, tool_choice={\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"return_length_estimate\"}}\n)\nFor ever-longer snippets of a Wikipedia article, here’s GPT 3.5 Turbo’s estimates:\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nIt’s fairly accurate at lower sequence lengths, but diverges and starts to estimate that anything long is ~1000 words. GPT-4 also got worse above ~800 words, but with less of an obvious trend. More pics in my original Twitter thread.\nThinking through how these models might infer the length, one possibility is that the positional embeddings can be used to estimate the length of the sequence. If the model is able to compare the positional embeddings of the first and last token, it could estimate the length of the sequence. To see how clearly positional info comes through in the latent representations of the model, fed some sequences of various lengths through the recently-released gemma-7B model and stored the final layer outputs (outputs.last_hidden_state). Then I fit a linear regression model on these to predict the token position from the latent representation. The R^2 was 0.99, so the positional information is very clear in the latent representations. As you can see, there’s enough information in the latent representations to estimate the length of the sequence fairly well:\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nOne interesting thought: many models are trained at some lower context length (1024 or 2048 for example) the briefly fine-tuned on longer sequences at the end of training. A popular recent strategy is to do some kind of dynamic scaling (see dynamic RoPE scaling for e.g.) where the positional embeddings for linger sequences are scaled such that they map to the same range as the positional embeddings for the shorter sequences the model was trained with. If this is the case, you’d expect length estimates for sequences above the training context length to be less accurate, and specifically to be underestimates since the positional embeddings of token, say, 4217 would be rescaled back to look like the positional embeddings of token 1024. The pattern for GPT-3.5 Turbo’s estimates seems to fit this hypothesis, but of course we don’t have a way to know for sure.\nThis was a fun little experiment, and it’s unlikely I’ll take it further, but I hope it’s given you some food for thought and perhaps a few ideas for your own experiments."

    "text": "CIRTS - Configurable Infra-Red Tomography systems\nUsing cheap IR LEDs and phototransistors to understand tomography. Using machine learning to make inferences based on sensor data. Etc :)\nIntroduction\nThis project arose because I wanted to do some experiments with Computed Tomography, but I didn’t know enough to see what would work and what wouldn’t. How many sensors does one need to achieve a particular goal for resolution or performance? What geometries work best? And what if we can’t keep everything nice and regular?\n\nI built some tools that let me simulate these kinds of arrangements, and did some early experiments on image reconstruction and on the use of machine learning (specifically neural networks) to make sense of readings. Even with a weird arrangement like the on on the right, I could make some sense of the data. I’m not going to write up the simulation stuff here, but there is code and info in the GitHub repository. It will get tidied up and updated once the marking process ends.\nI tested out these arrangements in the real world by building some fixed arrangements, and by using a 3D printed scanner to position an LED and a phototransistor (PT from now on) in different locations to slowly simulate having many detectors and emitters.\n\n\n\nThe Rotating Scanner\n\n\nThis was fun to build - it was pretty much my first project using my 3D printer, and man was it easy to get something working fast! There are two components to the top surface, each of which is controlled by a stepper motor. The drive circuitry would be familiar to anyone who has played with 3D printers or other CNC machines. A teensy microcontroller board drives the steppers in response to commands from the computer and reads the light intensity at the PT with the built in ADC.\nThe above image shows a scan in progress. The outer ring moves the phototransistor around, taking readings. Then the object being scanned is rotated and the process is repeated. Here are some example scans:\n\nThese scans were pretty rough, but with tweaking it could image 0.1in pin headers:\n\nA view of the underside/internals\n\nI’ll post more on this if I get it out and do more scans, but that covers the basics. I can take a high-res scan and store that. Then later, if I’m looking building a ring of sensors with, for eg, 16 elements, I can see what the output would be by taking a subset of the higher res scan and working with that. So it let’s me try out new arrangements quite quickly, in the real world. A useful tool!\n\n\n\nFixed arrays of sensors\n\n\nThis was the end goal - building some sensor rings to take readings instantly rather than waiting for the rotating platform to build up a scan.\nThe first few I build had 8 LEDs and 8 PTs arranged in a ring:\n\nImage reconstruction on these was poor, as expected. But with some machine learning magic I could estimate position of an object within the ring to within ~3mm, and differentiate between different objects (for eg, pen and finger) with high accuracy. Pretty fun! I set up one ring as a game controller - a finger placed in the ring could be moved to steer a ship and dodge enemies.\nRaw image reconstruction of a finger moving:\n\nI’ll have to do a separate post about the ML work, or"

    "text": "Easy 3D Scanner\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n3D printers are pretty cool things, and with more and more people getting access to these lovely little machines, Makerbot decided that people needed an easier way to make 3d models without having to learn a bunch of new software. So they came up with a piece of software called makerscanner and released designs for a 3d scanner. However, their designs required 3D printed parts, a PS2 camera and a specific model of line laser. I didn’t have any of these things, but giving up is for quitters so I set out to see what I could do.\nThe first thing to do was to figure out the distance between the laser and the camera. I found it on a forum somewhere - 19.8cm. Fortunately, this was almost exactly the distance from my laptop’s webcam to the edge of the laptop, but if you want to change it you can edit ScanThread.cpp and adjust the line #define DISPARITY_DISTANCE 19.8 before re-compiling.\nNow I needed a line laser. This can probably be ordered online, but I am broke and impatient so instead I made my own lense to make a line laser with a nice strong laser pointer:\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nConsidering that this was done with a paperclip and a bit of broken wine glass, it actually works suprisingly well!\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nThe procedure is simple - fire up makerscanner, input the distance to your backdrop and then sweep your laser back and fourth over the object to be scanned. It needs to be in some sort of pivot. For the top image I used a retort stand in our school lab to scan a teachers cup, but I have also taped the laser to an arrow, basically whatever is on hand should work fine. The resulting point cloud can be viewed in meshlab immediately, but will need some adjustment to get a 3D model. If you (like me) live in a country whose locale specifies the comma as a decimal point, the point cloud will not open in anything, but don’t despair! I managed to fix the problem by opening makerscanner with the following command (this will probably be different if you are not on linux): ‘LC_ALL=C makerscanner’.\nPost-processing is relatively painless, but there is a tutorial on the makerscanner site so I won’t go into detail. The idea is to take several scans and then combine them into one model, but depending on what you are scanning you can get a very rough model from just one scan:\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nSo there you go, a 3D scanner that I built in half an hour - a simple but really cool project to try next time you’re bored."

Coke looks like water, bills reveal secret patterns and your TV remote becomes a torch!\nThe method really depends on your camera, but basically what you are doing is locating the CCD chip (which records the images) and removing the tiny, fragile piece of IR-blocking glass, then replacing it with a piece of something that blocks visible light but lets through infra-red. This works because most CCD chips can pick up NIR - they usually just block it before it reaches the chip. I experimented with a couple of different filters - both old floppy disk and overexposed camera film work well. They have to be cut to squares about 5mm a side, and getting these to fit over the chip was the hardest part of this project.

The bread was sweet, the bacon maple-coated… Tasty, but odd after 5 years eating fairly healthy and basic food in Zimbabwe. Why is everything full of corn syrup? Why have I gained weight? Part of the answer is ‘optimization’ - when you optimize for sales, you can end up hacking the human brain in ways that aren’t good for us. Sweeter chocolate milk sells better, so more sugar is added until you get the thick sludge that people drink here. Cheap and tasty are all well and good, but it’s clear there are downsides, and it’s clear you mightant to spend considerable effort fighting the tempation and seeking out healthier alternatives. Short-term optimization for human preferences can lead to long-term harm. Anyway, on an unrelated note, let’s talk about AI!"

    "section": "What Makes A Tasty Model?",
    "text": "What Makes A Tasty Model?\nToday’s LLMs go through a few different phases of training. There’s ‘pretraining’, where the model is shown a lot of text and learns to predict the next word. Then there’s ‘fine-tuning’, where the model is shown a few examples of a specific task (like being a helpful assistant) and learns to predict the next word in that context. Finally, there’s ‘RLHF’ (or more generally ‘preference tuning’) where the model is trained with feedback about which outputs human raters (or a proxy model for human preferences) prefer. This is a bit like the difference between a slot machine, iterative refinement, and co-creation.\nAt a meta level, the choices influencing how exactly these stages are condicted, and how successful they are considered to be, is based on benchmarks (aka ’evals) that try to measure how well the model is doing. Some involve asking hard questions, which rewards informative pretraining data and careful instruction following. But more and more rely on human ratings to measure the model responses. For example, LMSys pits models head-to-head and has humans pick their preferred answer. All the model makers pay attention to performance on these comparisons, testing variants of their models before release and tuning them based on past votes.\nWhat is the result? We’re optimizing models to make the human raters happy. On the surface it seems like a fantastic thing - better answers (measured by rater preference) mean a better, more helpful, more useful model. Right?\nExcept remember the food thing. You can score well on these human-preference-based evals with a few tricks:\n\nLong answers. People love to see lots of informative and authoratative-sounding text.\nLots of code. Look, it wrote a whole app for me.\nNicely formatted markdown. Headings, bullet points, bold text. Dopamine central!\nSycophancy. “What an insightful question!”, “That’s quite an insight, would you like to delve deeper into this fascinating topic”. Seriously - look back at your interactions with your favourite AI and think why you like talking to it - is it just flattering you? (“Nooooo Claude is my friend…”)\n\nI’m not saying all of these are bad. But think for a sec - are any of these a little like high-fructose corn syrup? Do you really want your apps full of verbose, pleasing-looking walls of code? Your essays the most appeal-to-the-masses slop? Your images the highly-saturated instagram-dominating preference-optimizing eye-candy?"

But I’m starting to think this won’t make you a better programmer in the long term. Spending the time to learn, doing things carefully yourself, making things yourself rather than having them made - these are the cooking-at-home equiavalents that will pay future dividends. Use AI - the same way we can use fancy ingredients and equipment in a home kitchen. Just don’t give up your life to fast-food or let your intelligence atrophy from lack of use. Avoid the floaty-chairs of Wall-E! Embrace co-creation and make something that’s truly yours, not just the most appealing to the masses.\nWIP: Or something.

    "text": "In this post I’ll share a mental model that I’ve found useful recently in thinking through a number of topics related to AI and creativity. I call it the “3 Modes of Making with AI”. This framing has helped me think though how I feel about different coding tools, tease out some nuance in the debate around AI art, and imagine some possible futures I want to build towards!\nThe trick is to separate out uses of AI into three categories (although in practice it’s often more like a sliding scale). These are:\nAs you move from 1 to 3, the agency of the human creator increases, and the output shifts from something ‘generic’ (that anyone might get) to something individual and unique. All three modes have their place of course, as we’ll see as I dig into each a little more, but explicitly thinking about which zone we’re aiming for can have a big impact on the kinds of tools we make, and I think at present the co-creation aspect that centers the human creator is in need of a little more love! So, let’s go through these in a little more detail and then look at some ways we can help shift the balance towards my favourite end of this spectrum :)"

In these cases, hooray - we have these amazing models that can do these kinds of thigns, in a way that felt like magic just a few years ago! Notice how quickly the magic fades though - I’m really not interested in your midjourney gallery, despite the fact that all the image outputs there are technically far better than anything I could make or generate a year or two ago."

    "text": "Iterative Refinement\nOne immediate upgrade to the above is going through a few rounds of refinement. For text/code models, this can be pointing out a few mistakes or clarifying a requirement, all the way up to asking for many re-writes with detailed feedback each time. For image models, I like the direction Playground are going, where you ask in natural language for edits. Even ChatGPT’s more primitive image gen can do this though - repeatedly asking for “more cute” on a picture of a duckling or something can be entertaining :)\nMy favourite application of this approach is Claude Artifacts. You can describe a web app you want, and Claude will typically do a pretty good job giving you a working prototype! Then, over the course of a few conversation turns, you can refine the design by asking for changes like ‘add a button to sort the list’ or ‘make the logo bigger’. This (and Replit agents for similar cases that need a backend or other functionality not avaiable in Artifacts) is a perfect match for making fun bits of ephemeral software. Recent examples where I’ve used this to good effect are:\n\nMaking a web-based grading tool for an assignment my wife was marking\nWhipping up a few mini-sites for my father-in-law’s card game prototype\nSome little musical tools, which I exported out of artifacts and deployed as shown here\n\nWith this mode, the more you put in, the more you get out - starting with a list of requirements, a picture/sketch of what you want or something personal will get you a much more unique result that a generic ‘make me HTML snake’ prompt. Likewise with iterating with string opinions - ask for changes you want to see rather than accepting the first generic input! As you spend more and more effort, the results get closer to mode 3…"

    "text": "Basement Hydroponics: Part 1\nI’ve been dabbling with hydroponics in my basement since discovering some unused grow lights from someone else’s abandoned attempt. It’s fun to see things grow! The system has also doubled as a way to start seeds indoors before transplanting them outside, and gave various flowers and herbs a head start. Now that all the seedlings are planted out, this is what the system looks like in its current state:\n\n\n\nThe setup\n\n\nThere’s a gazillion youtube videos and dedicated kits for hydroponics, but the simple fact is that plants do OK if you dunk them in water filled with nutrients and the rest is mostly fluff to get you to buy someone’s over-priced pump or whatever. I’m using some nurtrients from the same abandoned project that left me the lights, and the rest is just stuff I had lying around. I opted for a Kratky-style system, which is a set-and-forget style of hydroponics where the plants wick up nutrient from a tank that starts mostly full and slowly empties as the plants grow. I started seeds in ‘Jiffy Peat Pellets’ which can be suspended in holes in the containers by shoving some screws or skewers through them. For some smaller experiments I’ve had success using smaller bottles with a cap I 3d-printed:\n\n\n\nA basil plant in a small bottle, showing air roots and root system\n\n\nThis is inspired by the excellent Falcoponics system invented by Sebastian S. Cocioba (@ATinyGreenCell) for small-scale hydroponics. With these smaller containers you need to top up the water more often, but it’s a fantastic approach for testing out ideas without needing to wrangle hoses or worrying about contaminating some big central reservoir.\nWe’ve been consistently harvesting basil and chard, and there are flowers on the engineered purple tomato plant so stay tuned for a part 2 if that works out :) The only downside to this nice efficient system that I’ve set up is that it actually doesn’t require any input from me, which makes it not much of a hobby! I may have to start experimenting with some fast-growing plants and try to do more experiments in the small bottle system I’ve developed, just for an excuse to go smell the good green smells and tinker more frequently…\nPS: I must confess that amid the low-SNR youtube I ended up watching on this topic I did get a little addicted to the cheerful Australian enthusiasm of “Hoocho’s Hydroponics” - if you’re looking to learn all things hydroponics I can recommend his channel!"

    "text": "My Saturday Morning Project\n\n\nI wanted to do something physical. Maybe a motion system that’s not just another cartesian X/Y thing? Something I can test out Kalman filters and control systems on? Something that could move a magnet to pull a ball bearing around on some sand in that oh-so-satisfying way?\nThey way this came together is a nice example of one of my favourite ways to make something - which I’ve started calling ‘doodling in hardware’. Once I had a vague idea of what I wanted to make, I drew out some quick sketches, took a few measurements, and set the base printing. Here’s the sketch:\n\n\n\nsketch next to ‘finished’ prototype\n\n\nWhile the base printed I could take apart my robot arm to scavenge the servos and start messing with figuring out how to move to a certain X/Y position given different dimensions of the robot (code explorations at the end of this post). I also designed the holders to fit the servos.\nWhile the ‘servo horns’ were printing, I could assemble the circuit on the base, get the motors moving, and design the swivel mechanisms.\nWhile the swivel bits were printing I could walk to the hardware store for 1/4 inch dowels (or maybe I did that earlier?).\nYou see the trend? These prints take 20-30 minutes (or an hour or so for the base IIRC). Just enough time to tinker with existing things or work on a revision. The upshot is a morning spent in flow, a precious gift. This is the dream! It’s not like I have a super-fancy workshop yet but even the baseline here is enough that I’m not hitting blockers that throw the project as much as I used to. My junk bins are growing more bountiful, my tools more capable.\nThis particularly project is pretty silly. I spotted some obvious flaws once it was assembled and moving about that will need correcting in a possible V2. But I’m so happy I am in a place I can occasionally tinker with something silly like this and have the process be so smooth and enjoyable :)\nOK, now the code as promised. I code all day for my job, so for weekend projects like this the goal is to avoid it as much as possible and have AI do the boring bits.\n\n\nAside: This is the end result of some prompting across a few different AI’s.

    "text": "I’ve been dabbling with DIY biology, trying to modify some genes in ecoli and generally just messing about. Doing something like “making bacteria/yeast that glow under UV” is suprisingly common and looks easy at first glance - just mix the right things together with suitable wait times and temperatures between steps… There are even companies that will ship you kits with all the bits you need - I got a kit from The ODIN who are trying to make all of this more accessible.\n\n\n\nLaying out the bits needed for my first experiment\n\n\nIt’s my firm belief when cooking that most recipes are needlessly over-complicated and rife with superstition. If you understand what’s actually going on, you can simplify and substitute and often end up with a better result. I have to confess I had a feeling the same might be true for bio stuff - these people seem so obsessed with their exact measurements and protocols, and the focus on sterility seems completely overkill… Spoiler alert: I now see where they’re coming from! There are a few things that contribute to this being more difficult that it seems at first. Let’s dig in.\n\n\nA key issue is iteration time. If you miss a line of code, your program usually errors out right away. If you get a step wrong trying to edit DNA, you only know about it a few days later when you see another petri dish full of normal-looking bacteria refusing to do what you want them to. This makes it a lot harder to hack around and try different things quickly. If you think ahead you can try multiple things in parallel, but it’s still a pain to have so little immediate feedback on what’s going on. I bet experienced people have more intuition - this smells like the right strain, that looks too cloudy, the water bath feels just right.\nOne example that tripped me up: after adding the plasmid to my bacteria transformation mix, the protocol said something like “incubate at 37 degrees for… then mix and then spread on the plate…”. I forgot to shake up the tube, and had spread a few drops on one plate before I noticed that (of course) things had settled to the bottom of the tube. I mixed it up and then spread a few drops on another plate - sure enough I got growth on only the second plate. If you missed that one key phrase, you wouldn’t even know where you went wrong and 48 hours later you’d be scratching your head wondering what went wrong.\n\n\n\nDoing the same thing twice and (hopefully) getting the same result twice is a luxury I’m used to from software. In biology, it’s very easy for this to break. Your starting culture is different, things get contaminated very easily, and the real world interfears and makes it easy for things like ambient temperature to change between runs. This made me understand more the focus on controlling everything. Room temp probably didn’t mess that try up, but it’s one more thing I have to worry about - easier to just keep things incubated at a constant temp and eliminate that variable.\n\n\n\nA plate gone wrong\n\n\nSame goes for sterility. You learn to do the dance of using gloves, sanitising evreything, using stuff once and disposing of it (I hate this part, it feels so wasteful). The alternative is cutting 10 corners, 9 of which might have made sense but the 10th one is the one that ruins your experiment. First try I was very blasé about this, keeping my plates at room temp, working on a dirty desk, etc. My most recent run I did a lot more ‘properly’ and got much better results. And I’d still probably need to work a lot harder to get to a point where I can be confident every time that I’m not contaminating things accidentally.\n\n\n\nIt’s one thing to follow someone’s protocol with their kit. But you’re very dependent on this third party. Part of this means there are things you can’t control (my first kit was from a batch that might have had some issues their side, thankfully they shipped a replacement). It also makes it harder to break out on your own. I can use the existing glowy plasmids, but if I want to design my own there’s a steep learning curve and a big price-tag ($$$$) involved for getting them made. Doable for a passionate few, but pretty intimidating fomr someone just wanting to dabble.\n\n\n\nAnyway, those are just some rough thoughts. I’ve sterilized my plates and packed away my pipettes for now. This hobby seems super interesting but not quite suited to my personal temperment. Luckily for me I don’t have to abandon it completely though - I have friend deeper in the rabbit hole than myself and I think I can be content helping out with smaller things that I can be more confident of - making lab equipment, brainstorming together and that sort of thing. If we come up with something fun you may see more squishy science content here! For now, I’m off to dabble with the next potential hobby :)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "VDG in an hour (from junk)\n\nOur school has a Van de Graaff generator - it is pretty much a must-have for a physics lab. We used to have a teacher who used it often, zapping us with a lyden jar whenever some of the class were missing and we needed a more low-key lesson (this is great fun!!). However, he left and now it gets pulled out at open days and used for one lesson on static electricity per year. For such low usage it is a pretty expensive piece of equipment - I don’t know how much ours cost but even very low-end ones on amazon are upwards of $200. Surely there must be a cheaper option! The following monstrosity is not fit to replace our lab one, in fact I purposefully did lots of stuff wrong so that I can then explain how one would go about building a cheap Van de Graaff generator out of whatever you have lying around, and I hope that by doing it this way I can say what NOT to do but also show how easy it is to get sparks.\nFirst up, you need a way to move the belt. This can be whatever you have handy - a washing machine motor, one from an RC car or even just a hand crank. All that is required is that it generate enough torque (spinning power) to spin your belt at a decent speed. Old fans are great for this purpose, and they even have adjustable speed. I had one lying around with a PVC pipe already glued on in place of the blades, a relic of a past VDG project (that was never finished…) . I pulled this out, blew the sawdust off and added a bulge of insulation tape in the middle of the PVC to hold the belt in place (more on this later). Drive motor - check. Now for the belt. This is going to ferry charge to the dome, and is one of the most important bits. I remembered that my mom had a nice piece of stretchy rubber for exersise. Belt - check! Now for your dome. This is where the charge is stored. I have been looking hopefully around shops for a nice domed metal bowl, but no luck. Instead, I settled for a plastic bowl wrapped in aluminium foil. Dome - check. Here is what it looked like at this point:\nNow for the other roller. I used a piece of bamboo that was lying on the ground. In the middle is another bulge of tape (this magically keeps the belt central) and a screwdriver is threaded through the middle. A ruled keeps it from slipping off. This is what it looks like:\n\nAnd under the belt:\n\nAs you can see from the first picture, the top brush was just mangled foil. For the bottom a ran a cable from the ground of a plug to just below the roller and splayed out the end. After that I turned it on and presto - it worked! Because of the rubbish dome it only produced 1cm sparks but it was enough to give a decent shock. When my little brother stood on a “rubber mat” (actually cricket pads) I could shock him by flicking my finger near his ear, and he gave my dad a fright with a shocking handshake.\nTo get a bit more juice, I built a leyden jar - in this case just a cup half full with salty water, a teaspoon and some aluminium foil. This works as a capacitor to store charge and make a better spark:\n\nThis gave a brighter spark, and a much bigger jolt. To charge it, I just held the cup so that the spoon was by the dome. Check out the comparison of the spark from the dome and the spark when I moved the spoon close to the foil. First the normal, tiny spark (it produced way longer ones but they didn’t show in the photos)\nNow the spark from the jar - much brighter:\n\nHow it SHOULD be done This worked surprisingly well, but it could be vastly better. Here is how each part should have been made: The Dome This is the worst part of my whole build. The size of the dome determines the length of spark you are going to achieve. Ideally it should be a smooth sphere (or as close as you can get to that) with as few pointy bits as possible as these cause corona discharge and you loose voltage. The bigger the radius, the better. It should also be isolated as completely as possible. My foil-covered bowl was as far from this as you can get, hence the puny 1000V sparks. The Rollers In this build I just used whatever was close to hand for rollers, but ideally a lot more thought should go into them. Obviously, they should spin easily with little wobble (unlike mine). Use masking tape to create a bulge in the middle before covering them in your chosen material. Choosing the materials affects the rate of charging of the dome, and may seem complicated. It is actually pretty easy. It all comes down to something called the triboelectric series. Simply coat one roller in a material from high up in the series (nylon for example) and one from the bottom (teflon is easy - plumbers tape). Swapping the two rollers will cause the dome to become positively charged or negatively charged. Experiment to find out which works better for you. The Brushes These should have many points close to, but not touching, the belt. A trimmed piece of gauze works well, but steel wool or just stripped multi-core wire will work fine. It is possible to work out whether they should be placed just before the roller or just after, but this is hard to explain and easy to work out by experimentation. If you are not sure, sticking them directly above or below the roller should work fine :). The Belt For the belt, try to choose a material somewhere between your two rollers in the series. Do NOT use rubber from an inner tube, as it does not work at all. It turns out that my mom’s exersize belt was actually perfect for the job and the favourite of hobby VDG builders. Obviously a smoother join would be better, and the broader the belt the faster your VDG will charge. Keep the belt dry and free from oil as much as possible, as this will affect performance. General tips - The internet is full of tutorials for building VGDs. It help if you read a few of these before starting on your own. - Any moisture or humidity vastly reduces performance, so ttry to keep everything as dry as possible and don’t complain if it stops working on rainy days. - There are not really any specialised parts needed, and you should have almost everything needed to complete this project around your house. Don’t be discouraged if you cannot find something mentioned in a tutorial - just find a substitute! - Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment and fail. If it doesn’t work, ask yourself why and then fix the problem. This is a really fun machine to build and play with.

I’m a sucker for chances to talk about things I’m interested in, but these also generally take a lot more time than I would anticipate. Cost: ~6-24 hours, less if it sounds fun, less if I can share a recording publically, less if it’s a good cause.\nYou’d like me to run some training sessions or to provide technical assistance to get your team up to speed on something. Great! This is a format I’m less familiar with and cost would be highly dependent on the project, but likely 10+ hours per 1h contact time.\nYou have a specific problem or project related to my expertise. We meet and it sounds doable. I spend 20 hours over two weeks delivering a demo solution. Cost: 20 hours\nYou have a research question and would like me to spend time looking at it. Perhaps you’d like me to explore how some new method applies to your domain, or to try and invent some novel solution to a problem you’re facing. R&D is much harder to predict ahead of time, so I tend to work on ‘the best I can do in timeframe X’ rather than promising deliverables. I’d likely suggest a more flexible staged approach: 20 hours to look into it, then meet and decide to spend another month pushing for some specific outcomes, and then plan further from there.\nYou’d like me to join your team for the next 6 months to work on multiple research questions. Cost 3 days * 8 hours per week, rate negotiable"

    "text": "Why Not Full-Time?\nWhile I’m not completely closed to the idea of taking a full-time position somewhere, there are a few reasons I’m reluctant to do so:\n\nMy productivity tends to fluctuate. There are times when I feel extremely productive and times when I can’t get much done. Hitting the latter when someone is paying me a salary feels wrong! Perhaps naive, but I just don’t have the kind of mindset that can sit back and take a salary I don’t feel is deserved.\nBeing able to dial up or down the amount of work I have on my plate is the most effective solution to burnout and depression that I’ve found. A clear end in sight makes all the difference when facing a slump!\nI’ve become rather attached to having time to pursue my projects and research ideas. Having ‘free time’ to create free resources, learn new things, or pursue non-tech passions and interests is fantastic. More on this in the next section…\n\nOf course, there are perks to having a consistent employer too - health insurance, stability and the friends and mentors that would come with a team chief among them. I’ve toyed with looking for “full-time part-time” work (say, 3 days/week) which might balance the best of both worlds. If you have ideas on this front, let me know!"

    "text": "Self-funded Research\nI’ve spoken with several smart people recently who’ve all said variants of the same things:\n\nthey feel they do best at ~4h/day of focused creative work (on average)\nthey’d love some time off to pursue their own cool ideas\ntheir previous experiences of sabbaticals / “research holidays” have always led to even better opportunities down the road\n\n“Wouldn’t it be nice if some rich person would just give us money to do cool s***” we joke. “Yeah, like a patron! Maybe some aristocrat would let me live in their hermitage with a rack of GPUs to play with…”. The truth is, for those of us privileged enough to be working in this lucrative field, being that patron for yourself is potentially doable!\nI’ve been doing something like this my whole career, and it’s working out so far. Let’s explore why more people aren’t doing this (yet) and then I’ll share my own experience and tips.\n\nObstacle 1: realizing this is even an option\nShould I join/start a start-up or work at a big co? Move to SF and work at FAANG or get a bigger house in cheaper city X and take a remote role with a pay cut? Retire at 50 or 70? These are NOT your only choices! Looking past the traditional paths requires a pretty heavy mindset shift.\n\n\nObstacle 2: accepting the opportunity cost\nPeople make insane amounts of money working at big tech companies. My mind explodes when I hear the salaries. Giving that up seems crazy! Maybe it is, but consider that many of those people want more $ so they can eventually, one day, maybe, have time to do what they really want to do. If you can skip straight to that end goal, then perhaps it’s not so crazy…\n\n\nObstacle 3: what if this means I can’t go back?\nYour resume might be less typical, but on the other hand, the growth I’ve seen exploring these alternate paths is a lot higher than I’d have gotten with N years at a single company. Others I’ve spoken to have had the same experience - finding new opportunities and clients based on their curiosity-driven side projects. As one good friend put it: “That’s the magic of farting [around]”.\nThe larger danger might be that you can’t go back because it’s too nice! Consider this quote from Simon Willison’s recent talk on ‘Financial sustainability for open source projects’:\n\nSo I got paid to spend a year working on my open source projects, which, with hindsight, completely ruined me. Because once you’ve got to spend a year just working on the things you want to work on, it’s very difficult to accept somebody else stepping in telling you to work on other things instead.\nSince that fellowship ended, I’ve been mainly living off savings and occasionally picking up bits of consulting work— and trying to keep that ball rolling, because I’m enjoying myself so much.\n\nSimon is incredibly productive and inspiring - I really hope he can continue to make it work from him, and that more people can try this out!\n\n\nMy Experience\nIn 2014, fresh out of high school, I did some work on several ecology-related projects as the ‘computer guy’ - modeling species distributions, doing the mapping/GIS, trying some ML stuff on satellite data, lots of stats and data viz. A consequence of this was that throughout my time at University I had occasional parcels of work coming my way, providing a trickle of pocket money and a portfolio that helped me land a contract with a Data Science consulting company sometime in my third year. That went well enough that by the time I finished my studies a year later, I had some decent savings and a good (if small) network of contacts. I got married and moved back to Zimbabwe, where our plan was to extend the honeymoon until the money ran out. It didn’t! I kept getting chunks of work that more than covered our minimal (~$600/month) COL.\nTowards the end of 2020 I was working one half-time job and juggling a few other contracts - I’d said yes to too much, and ended up burning out. Shout out to Zindi for being the most epic and understanding employer ever. I quit all the things and took a few months completely off, spending a lot of time outdoors. It was phenomenal being able to take that time to recover, and then to sloooowly ease back into coding over the next year or two beginning with things that seemed fun. My wife’s local income plus our savings removed a lot of pressure. And amusingly the dabbles with (at that time) nice and ‘silly’ topics like AI-generated images and such ended up giving me a few years head-start on the generative AI craze, which has been rather convenient!\nThis year has been pretty atypical, with a move to the US and lots of family-related travel, but I’m slowly settling into a routine: a chunk of consulting comes through, then I take a break, then I dabble with personal projects, then someone reaches out with more work… rinse and repeat. Projects range from a one-week implementation of some specific idea all the way up to my 5-month stint as a part-time ‘Builder In Residence’ with PlaygoundAI working on a whole bunch of projects. On the side, I’ve been ‘researching with friends’ (a nice change from the solo stuff) in a collaboration that started late last year when I teamed up with some fellow nerds to make part 2 of the fast.ai course, diving into diffusion models.\nThe majority of my time is spent on non-income-generating activities - making courses/videos, trying out projects based on research questions or idle curiosity, spending lots of time with family, and trying to stay current with the firehose of research coming out each week in this field.\nIt feels a little precarious (and extremely privileged) to rely on usually having a queue of potential clients hanging around, but for now there seems to be enough demand to keep me as busy as I want to be. I don’t have enough data to tell yet how sustainable this will be long-term with the higher costs associated with living here in the US, but I’ve met enough friends in similar situations making it work that I’m hopeful! Stay tuned for updates :)"

To give you an idea of some of my reference points:\n\nA rural farm laborer in Zimbabwe might earn $60 a month\nA teacher at the fanciest private school maybe $1,200 per month, which is enough to live a comparatively lavish life in the capital city\nMy first ‘Data Science’ gig in SA was something like $500/week (extreme riches to a student) and later work probably peaked more like $500/day (call it $60/hour). It felt (and still feels) almost obscene to get more for a days coding than many in the country make in a year.\n\nSo, as you can imagine, salaries in the AI space (where TC at big players can run to 7 figures) actually melt my brain. To date, my strategy is to reluctantly up my rates when I have to, to think about it as little as possible, and to send lots of money back home to spread it around more in places where the dollars go a lot further :)"

Instead of taking the difference only, you can borrow from the diffusion model playbook and do something like classifier-free guidance where you lerp between [the final logits] and [the difference thing they use in DoLa] with a scale like 0.5 or 3. Seems to work!\nTrying it on two different styles of 0-shot classification with Llama-7.

None of these projects are particularly exemplary, but that’s sort of the point - if they were good, they’d cout as work!

    "section": "NotFriend",
    "text": "NotFriend\nProject URL: notfriend.org Code: https://github.com/johnowhitaker/notfriend\n\n\n\nNotFriend landing page\n\n\nIn one of our answerai ‘watercooler’ calls, the topic of the ‘Friend’ pendant came up. I jokingly onted that notfriend.org was available, and that we should do some sort of parody. I did my more serious work for the day then knocked out the site (now visible at notfriend-production.up.railway.app - more on that shortly) that evening, sharing it the next morning once I’d tested the payments and tweaked a few minor UI things to my satisfaction.\nIt seems like the standard approach to designing a visually appealing site these days is to hire a designer to sketch out the ‘look’ of a site in figma and then spend ages trying to match that in code. I got a taste of how tedious this can be helping to do exactly this for an internal project, and Jeremy had a similar experience working with the design team on the FastHTML homepage. We both came away with the same conclusion: how do people live like this? Alternative apporaches that feel more reasonable are:\n\nStart from a template\nUse a set library of components. We’re starting to explore this with fh-bootstrap, and there are community attempts to port things like shadcn to FastHTML.\nGet an AI to do all the hard work! Spoiler, this is what I went with for NotFriend :)\n\n\n\n\nV0 screenshot\n\n\nThe tool I tried is called Vercel V0, although OpenUI from Chris Van Pelt seems like a great open-source alternative that lets you control the model, system prompt etc. V0 spits out code, and has a mechanism for requesting design changes (“make the header larger, change the color palette to greens…”). I copied the generated HTML into our ‘h2f’ converter and voila - a decent-looking starting point to tinker with.\nAnother pleasingly simple part of the process was letting people actually buy the thing! Taking payments via stripe is as simple as setting a few secrets and then sending the user to a checkout page created by stripe:\n# They submit a form with their email, physical address and type of product\n@app.get(\"/buy/\")\ndef buy_credits(product:str, email:str, address:str):\n    s = stripe.checkout.Session.create(\n        payment_method_types=['card'],\n        metadata = {\"product\": product,\"email\":email,\"address\":address},\n        line_items=[{\n            'price_data': {\n                'currency': 'usd', 'unit_amount': 2496,\n                'product_data': {'name': f'You are buying a NotFriend ({product} version) - thank you for being a part of this!'},\n            }, 'quantity': 1,\n        }],\n        mode='payment',\n        success_url=DOMAIN + '/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',\n        cancel_url=DOMAIN + '/cancel',\n    )\n    return RedirectResponse(s['url'])\nYou can add a webhook to listen for successful payments and then update the user’s account in your database, but for this project I just manually checked the stripe dashboard and then sent orders to the addresses myself - passing the metadata along with the order made this easy. I had two sales - digging around the stripe dashboard to find the info was a perfectly reasonable approach. When you have thousands of sales you can set up automations, but that’s a good problem to have! I don’t want to make out that this is completely trivial, but wow the ability to set this up, and the ease with which I could pop a few notfriends in the mail and send them off, really highlights how doable it is to set up a small business online these days (if you’re lucky enough to live in the right place)."

This is how I ended up with Moodle!\nTo illistrate what I mean by locality of behaviour: if you want to know how the leaderboard works, you only have to look at one place main.py:\n@app.get('/leaderboard')\ndef leaderboard():\n    # Top 10 in last 24 hours and approved games only\n    fastest_games = games(where=\"end_time IS NOT NULL AND end_time &gt; strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 day') AND approved\",\n                        order_by=\"(end_time - start_time) ASC\",\n                        limit=10)\n    rows = []\n    for i, game in enumerate(fastest_games, 1):\n        duration = game.end_time - game.start_time\n        player_name = game.player_name if game.player_name else \"Anonymous\"\n        rows.append(\n            Tr(Td(str(i)), Td(player_name), Td(game.word),\n            Td(f\"{duration:.2f} seconds\"),\n            Td(A(\"View\", href=f\"/game-summary?game_id={game.id}\"))))\n\n    table = Table(Thead(\n        Tr(Th(\"Rank\"), Th(\"Player\"), Th(\"Word\"), Th(\"Duration\"),\n            Th(\"Details\"))),\n                    Tbody(*rows),\n                    cls=\"table table-striped table-hover\")\n\n    return Title(\"Leaderboard - Fastest Games\"),  Navbar(\"leaderboard\"),  Main(\n            H1(\"Top 10 Fastest Games (past 24 hours):\", style=\"text-align: left;\"),\n            table,\n            A(\"Back to Home\", href=\"/\"),\n            cls='container')\nWe’re at ~8,500 games played, and I’m going to write up another post on the model performance and such soonish, so I won’t go into that here. Key takeaway: FastHTML mostly got out the way so I could focus on thinking about what I wanted to add, and even though this app has sort of crossed the point where one might consider restructuring/refactoring it, it’s still very manageable. And the AI models that make it all work have cost us next to nothing so far. Magic!"

    "text": "Mini Experiment: Broken Multimodal Telephone\nAt a birthday party recently we played a game where a pad of paper is passed around a circle, with each person writing a sentence to describe a picture. The next person then draws a picture to match the sentence, and so on. The results are often hilarious, with the original sentence and the final picture often being completely different. Of course, the next day I had to replicate this with an image generation model and a multimodal model ping-ponging back and forth.\n\nTo generate the images, I went with Dalle-3 via the OpenAI API:\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nopenai_client = OpenAI(api_key=\"your_key\")\nresponse = openai_client.images.generate(\n  model=\"dall-e-3\",\n  prompt=\"The dolphins have taken over the world. The dolphin king celebrates.\",\n  size=\"1024x1024\",\n  quality=\"standard\",\n  n=1,\n)\nimage_url = response.data[0].url\nThis image URL can then be passed to Antropic’s Haiku model, which is fantastically cheap and capable of taking both images and text as inputs:\nmessage = anthropic_client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\",\n    max_tokens=100,\n    temperature=0.5,\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"image\",\n                    \"source\": {\n                        \"type\": \"base64\",\n                        \"media_type\": \"image/png\",\n                        \"data\": base64.b64encode(httpx.get(image_url).content).decode(\"utf-8\"),\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Provide a short description of the image.\"\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n    ],\n)\nprompt = message.content[0].text\nThen prompt can be passed back to Dalle-3 to generate a new image, and so on. Here are a few GIFs with some results:\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to see how long these stay coherent. Previous times I’ve tried this things have gone abstract fairly quickly, here the theme diverges but does get stuck in attractors that still often make sense. I look forward to repeating this as models improve :) If you try this and make anything fun let me know! Here’s how I make the GIFs:\ndef save_results_as_gif(results, filename, time_per_frame=1):\n    images = []\n    for prompt, image in results:\n        # Create a black image with the same size as the original image\n        black_image = PILImage.new(\"RGB\", image.size, (0, 0, 0))\n        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(black_image)\n        font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial_narrow_7.ttf\", 20)\n        text = \"Prompt: \" + prompt\n\n        # Add newlines to the text to roughly keep it within the image\n        text_lines = []\n        max_width = 80\n        line = ''\n        for word in text.split():\n            if len(line + word) &lt;= max_width:\n                line += word + ' '\n            else:\n                text_lines.append(line)\n                line = word + ' '\n        text_lines.append(line)\n        text = '\\n'.join(text_lines)\n\n        text_width, text_height = 800, 20\n        text_position = ((image.width - text_width) // 2, (image.height - text_height) // 2)\n        draw.text(text_position, text, font=font, fill=(255, 255, 255))\n\n        # Append the black image and the original image to the list of frames\n        images.append(black_image)\n        images.append(image)\n\n    # Save the frames as a GIF\n    imageio.mimsave(filename, images, duration=time_per_frame)\n\n# Example usage (results is a list of tuples of prompts and images)\nsave_results_as_gif(results, \"broken_telephone1.gif\", time_per_frame=1500)"

    "text": "I have been blogging for years on a free Wordpress account, but figured I should finally migrate to a custom setup. I’m using Quarto, and in this TIL I document how to export your blogs from Wordpress to Quarto. The whole process took about 20 minutes, thanks to a note I left for myself last time I tried the process :) The steps are:\n\nExport XML from wordpress. I used the standard process, Tools -&gt; Export -&gt; Export All (https://wordpress.org/support/article/tools-export-screen/) to get an XML file that contains all my posts etc.\nConvert the XML export to markdown. I used https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown. I ran ‘npx wordpress-export-to-markdown’ in the folder containing the export, following the prompts to create files with the right date format. I chose not to place them in separate folders.\nCopy-paste the files into a folder in your quarto blog\n\nTo actually have them show up in the blog you need to edit a couple of other files. Here’s what blog.qmd looks like:\n---\ntitle: \"DataScienceCastnet\"\nlisting:\n  contents: dsc\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: False\n---\nAnd then in the main _quarto.yml we add it like so:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"johnowhitaker.dev\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: blog.qmd\n        text: Data Science Castnet Blog\n        \nThat’s it - hooray for the TIL format that means this counts as a post :)"

    "text": "The first solution\nJan won a previous iteration of this hackathon, and was kind enough to share a starting notebook (available here) with code to get up and running. You can view the notebook for the full code, but the steps are both simple and incredibly powerful:\n\nLoad the data into a ‘databunch’, containing both the labeled training data and the unlabeled test data. Using 15% of the training data as a validation set. The images are scaled to 224px squares and grouped into batches.\n\n\nThe images are automatically warped randomly each time (to make the model more robust). This can be configured, but the default is pretty good.\n\nCreate a model: learn = cnn_learner(data, resnet18, metrics=accuracy). This single line does a lot! It downloads a pre-trained network (resnet18) that has already been optimised for image classification. It reconfigures the output of that network to match the number of classes in our problem. It links the model to the data, freezes the weights of the internal layers, and gives us a model ready for re-training on our own classes.\nPick a learning rate, by calling learn.lr_find() followed by learn.recorder.plot() and picking one just before the graph bottoms out (OK, it’s more complicated than that but you can learn the arcane art of lr optimization elsewhere)\n\n\n*sucks thumb* A learning rate of 0.05 looks fine to me Bob.\n\nFit the model with learn.fit_one_cycle(3, lr) (Change number of epochs from 3 to taste), make predictions, submit!\n\nThere is some extra glue code to format things correctly, find the data and so on. But this is in essence a full image classification workflow, in a deceptively easy package. Following the notebook results in a log-loss score of ~0.56, which was on par with the top few entries on the leaderboard at the start of the hackathon. In the starter notebook Jan gave some suggestions for ways to improve, and it looks like the winners tried a few of those. The best score of the day was Ivor (Congrats!!) with a log-loss of 0.46. Prizes were won, fun was had and we all learned how easy it can be to build an image classifier by standing on the shoulders of giants."

An obvious answer would be to crop the images a little - there aren’t potholes in the dashboard or the sky! I don’t think anyone tried it, so let’s give it a go now and see where we get. One StackOverflow page later, I had code to crop and warp an image:\n\nBefore and after warping. Now the road is the focus, and we’re not wasting effort on the periphery.\nI ran my code to warp all the images and store them in a new folder. Then I basically re-ran Jan’s starting notebook using the warped images (scaled to 200x200), trained for 5 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1, made predictions and…. 0.367 - straight to the top of the leader-board. The image warping and training took 1.5 hours on my poor little laptop CPU, which sort of limits how much iterating I’m willing to do. Fortunately, Google Colab gives a free GPU, cutting that time to a few minutes."

Web Scraping to the rescue!\n\nA neat(ish) dataset of tunes in ABC notation\nYou can see the code and details here. Web scraping is one of those cases where there are many valid approaches one could take, but all of them in essence boil down to identifying ways of identifying the specific parts of the html code that surround the data you are interested in. For example, on a page of results from thesession each song is listed as a list item taking the form &lt;li class=\"manifest-item\"&gt;. With a bit of patience we can get URLs for each tune and then scrape the relevant info from those URLs with some more effort. At the end of this process, a nice neat dataframe with the titles, metadata and note sequences."

    "text": "Modelling\nWe’re going to train a ‘language mode’ - a concept from the field of NLP, where a model (usually an LSTM or transformer - based architecture) tries to predict the next token in a sequence, allowing it to learn from unstructured data such as large chunks of text or, in this case, music. The end result of this is a generative model that can ‘autocomplete’ sequences. These language models can then be re-purposed for classification, translation etc. but in this case we want a generative model so that is unnecessary.\nThe text needs to be tokenized. We can simply split into individual characters, but since the notation includes ‘note modifiers’ such as ‘=’ which are sometimes placed before a note to sharpen or flatten it and some other 2-character symbols (like ‘|:’ for the start of a bar with a repeat), I chose to build a custom tokenizer. The notebook shows how to construct fastai dataloaders that package everything up neatly ready for training.\n\nOnce the dataloaders are ready, we can simply train this like any other language model. I used the learning rate finder (output shown above) to pick an initial learning rate and then, following the example in the fastai docs, gradually unfroze the model and continued to train it. After a few minutes the model is predicting the next token with ~38% accuracy!"

The temperature parameter controls how ‘conservative’ the model is; higher values result in output with more randomness. To convert the string of letters that the model spews out into playable music, I used this handy online editor to preview, edit and download the songs.\nThe model is OK at guessing sensible notes, but it doesn’t produce much in the way of song structure. I found it best to use the output as a starting point, tweaking the odd bit of timing and adding repeats, separate parts and the odd extra flourish to create a song that is effectively co-written by myself and my AI assistant. It’s surprisingly fun! I hope this inspires you to try something like this yourself - do let me know what you create."

    "section": "Policy Networks",
    "text": "Policy Networks\nIn RL, a ‘policy’ is a map from game state to action. So when we talk about ‘Policy Learners’, ‘Policy Gradients’ or ‘Policy Networks’, we’re referring to something that is able to learn a good policy over time.\n\nThe network we’ll be training\nSo how would we ‘learn’ a policy? If we had a vast archive of past games, we could treat this as a supervised learning task - feed in the game state, chosen action and eventual reward for each action in the game history to a neural network or other learning algorithm and hope that it learns what ‘good’ actions look like. Sadly, we don’t have such an archive! So, we take the following approach:\n\nStart a game (an ‘episode’)\nFeed the game state through our policy network, which initially will give random output probabilities on each possible action\nPick an action, favoring those for which the network output is high\nKeep making actions and feeding the resultant game state through the network to pick the next one, until the game ends.\nCalculate the reward. If we won, +100. If we lost, -20. Maybe an extra +0.1 for each valid move made, and some negative reward for each time we tried to break the rules.\nUpdate the network, so that it (hopefully) will better predict which moves will result in positive rewards.\nStart another game and repeat, for as long as you want.\n\nHere’s a notebook where I implement this. The code borrows a little from this implementation (with associated blog post that explains it well). Some things I changed:\n\nThe initial example (like most resources you’ll find if you look around) chooses a problem with a single action - up or down, for example. I modified the network to take in 585 inputs (the Swoggle game state representation) and give out 192 outputs for the 62*3 possible actions an agent could take. I also added the final sigmoid layer since I’ll be interpreting the outputs as probabilities.\nMany implementations either take random actions (totally random) or look at the argmax of the network output. This isn’t great in our case - random actions are quite often invalid moves, but the top output of the network might also be invalid. Instead, we sample an action from the probability distribution represented by the network output. This is like the approach Andrej Karpathy takes in his classic ‘Pong from Pixels’ post (which I highly recommend).\nThis game is dice-based (which adds randomness) and not all actions are possible at all times, so I needed to add code to handle cases where the proposed move is invalid. In those cases, we add a small negative reward and try a different action.\nThe implementation I started from used a parameter epsilon to shift from exploration (making random moves) to optimal play (picking the top network output). I removed this - by sampling from the prob. distribution, we keep our agent on it’s toes, and it always has a chance of acting randomly/unpredictably. This should make it more fun to play against, while still keeping it’s ability to play well most of the time.\n\nThis whole approach takes a little bit of time to internalize, and I’m not best placed to explain it well. Check out the aforementioned ‘Pong from Pixels’ post and google for Policy Gradients to learn more."

Within a few games, my Agent was winning nearly 50% of games against the basic game AI (for a four player game, anything above 25% is great!). Digging a little deeper, I found my mistake. If the agent proposed a move that was invalid, it stayed where it was while the other agents moved around. This let it ‘camp’ on it’s base, or wait for a good dice roll before swoggling another base. I was able to get a similar win-rate with the following algorithm:\n\nPick a random move\nIf it’s valid, make the move. If not, stay put (not always a valid action but I gave the agent control of the board!)\n\nThat’s it - that’s the ‘CheatyAgent’ algorithm :) Fortunately, I’m not the first to have flaws in my game engine exploited by RL agents - check out the clip from OpenAI above!\n\nAnother bug: See where I wrote sr.dice() instead of dice_roll? This let the network re-roll if it proposed an invalid move, which could lead to artificially high performance.\nAfter a few more sneaky attempts by the AI to get around my rules, I finally got a setup that forced the AI to play by the rules, make valid moves and generally behave like a good and proper Swoggler should."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We often encounter imbalanced data in the world of machine learning, and have to decide how best to handle this. In ‘real life’ it is up to us to decide how to evaluate performance, which types of errors we care the most about and so on. But in the example we’ll look at today, the situation is slightly different: we have an imbalanced training set, and the test set (we’re working with this competition) has had the class distribution modified to make it more balanced. So, we need to find a way to take this into account when submitting predictions. The following plot shows the difference in distributions:\n\nClass distribution of the training set compared to the validation set\nIt’s worth pointing out that this is showing the results for the validation set - there is an unseen test set that could very well have it’s own slightly different class distribution. There isn’t much to say that wasn’t covered in the notebook, so check that out for implementation details. That said, let’s go over the main strategies we could use:\n\nDo nothing and hope for the best… Not great, but when the imbalance is small then some models are pretty decent at making sensible predictions. This isn’t going to win any competitions though!\nDrop some fraction of the majority class. This turned out to work surprisingly well - I suspect this mimics the steps the organizers took when preparing the data.\nGenerate some extra ‘synthetic’ samples for the under-represented class using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)\nCombine the steps 2 and 3, to avoid relying on too much synthetic data. In this case I chose to use the imblearn library’s RandomunderSampler to discard some of the majority class.\nTake advantage of the sample_weights parameter available in some models. For example, with Catboost we can explicitly tell the model to assign less weight to samples from the majority class. This lets us use the whole dataset (no need to throw out perfectly good data) and it performed the best in some experiments, loosing only to the basic under-sampling technique in the final assessment.\n\n\nDropping 5/6 of the rows from the majority class - a frustratingly successful approach!\nAgain, check out the notebook for details and code. Here are the results:\n\n\n\n\nStrategy\n\n\nLog Loss (local)\n\n\n\n\nUnder-sampling the majority class\n\n\n0.556998\n\n\n\n\nCatBoost with altered sample weights\n\n\n0.559395\n\n\n\n\nSMOTE + RandomUnderSampler\n\n\n0.579939\n\n\n\n\nNo modifications\n\n\n0.674555\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe big takeaway here for me was that getting this right makes a huge difference in these types of competition. Without a good strategy even the fanciest model has no hope of matching the top submissions. Fortunately, even basic under-sampling can get great results, and I hope that between my notebook and discussions from others sharing their tips we have an even playing field on this front, allowing competitors to work on the more interesting aspects like feature engineering."

The download interface is a little clunky, but simple once you get the hang of it. This short post will take a look at some typical data, and list some of the ways this could be used in the future.\n\nThe DWA website, after selecting ‘Verified data’.\nMost of the data comes from monitoring stations, each of which is assigned a unique ID. The easiest way to find stations in your area of interest is via the ‘Station Catalogue’ link visible in the above screenshot. Stations are typically a depth measure in a dam or river.\nWith a station chosen, the next step is to specify the date range and type of data you’d like to download. The available dates and information are listed in the Station Catalog. I picked a station in the Pongola river system, and saved the data file generated by the website as ‘daily_flows.txt’. This is a text file with variables separated by whitespace, and can be loaded into a pandas dataframe for analysis as follows:\n\nLoading the data.\nWith the data thus loaded, it’s fairly easy to pot the flow over a given year, or calculate monthly averages. Here’s a plot showing the daily flow rate out of Jozini dam in 2018. Note that the graph has many flat areas - this is because this is a managed flow, with the amount of water released from the dam regulated by local authorities (somewhat badly, in this case [2]).\n\nA plot of the daily flow rate.\nA notebook showing more plots and an example of re-sampling for yearly averages is available here.\nSo what can you do with this data? Here are some ideas (let me know if you’d like to see any as future posts):\n- Get dam level data for dams all over South Africa and and animate the levels over time, to illustrate the recent drought and the (alarming) longer trend.\n- Use the data to learn hydrodynamic modelling (see [1])\n- Combine with rain data to see how watershed capture has changed with agriculture and land use change\n- Look for the change in river flows after new projects (dams, diversions and so on)\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this brief glimpse at some fun data.

    "text": "Background\n\nGoogle Earth Engine\nGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) is an amazing tool for working with spatial data on a global scale. By writing some simple javascript, it’s possible to run computations on vast collections of image data thanks to the processing power hiding behind the scenes. Check out https://earthengine.google.com/ for more info.\n\n\nThe Tree\nThe African Baobab (Adansonia digitata and Adansonia kilima [1]) is an important tree in all countries where it is found. Besides its iconic looks, it provides tasty fruit full of good nutrients [2], bark fibre for crafts [3], traditional medicine [2], shade and an extra source of income [4] in some of the driest and most marginalized communities. Commercialization of the fruit is on the rise, especially for the export market. This is largely due to the fruit’s status as a ‘superfruit’. It’s important that organizations looking to harvest the fruit for sale have good information about the tree population so that they can pick good locations, estimate productivity and make sure that they are not over-harvesting and damaging this incredible resource.\nIn 2014, I was part of a team that set out to gather said information in Zimbabwe. We travelled all over the country, counting trees, assessing tree health, logging information about tree size and appearance and using questionnaires to find out more about how the trees were viewed and used by the communities who lived near them. This allowed us to produce a good map of the distribution within Zimbabwe, estimate potential yield in different areas and deliver a report on the overall health of the population. We also confirmed the presence of the newly discovered Adansonia kilima [5] - a second species of Baobab on mainland Africa that had only recently been described.\nFor that project, mapping the density of baobab trees was a tough task. I had to source gigabytes of data (not easy with Zimbabwe’s internet infrastructure), write some custom code to slowly crunch the numbers, tie together my own scripts with add-ons to QGIS (mapping software) and wait days for models to run. As you’ll see in the next few posts, Google Earth Engine makes the job significantly easier.\n\n\nThe data\nThere are two main types of data used in SDM. One is occurrence data - this can be points or areas where a species is known to occur. This is useful for calculating the probability of occurrence and creating maps showing where a species might be found, but less useful if you are trying to estimate density. The second type is ‘count data’ - the number of frogs in 10m2 or the total number of sightings along a transect. With count data, one can begin to predict how many of something will be found at a given location.\nThe data we collected in 2014 is count data - all the baobabs along road transects and walked transects were counted and their locations logged. The transects were subdivided into 200m by 200m plots, and each plot has an associated count - the number of baobab trees in that plot. There are 14,683 of these in the dataset, representing nearly 60 thousand hectares sampled. We could have subdivided the transects differently to get fewer, larger plots but we’ll leave that as a subject for a future post."

We want to examine all the factors that could affect where a tree grows. You can go really deep here, but since this post is just a first rough pass we’ll grab some climate-related layers and altitude (the latter because every document on baobab mentions that it is important). You could try searching directly for things like temperature, rainfall etc, but conveniently an org [check] called Worldclim has put together 19 variables derived from climate data that they deem “biologically meaningful values”. These include temperature seasonality, max rainfall, etc. Search for ‘worldclim’ and select ‘Worldclim BIO Variables V1’, which will give you a description of the dataset and allow you to import the data. Hit ‘Import’ and give it a sensible name - it will appear at the top of your script.\n\nAdd a second import with some elevation data. Elevation data is available in up to 30m resolution, but since we’re working on a large scale and the climate data is 1km resolution, using 30m resolution elevation data is a little overkill, and will slow things down. “ETOPO1: Global 1 Arc-Minute Elevation” is a lower resolution image we can use, or you can resample the high-res layer (see part 3 of this series for examples)."

    "text": "First try: Uber movement travel times as a proxy for traffic levels\nUber movement makes various data from millions of Uber rides available to the public. However, it isn’t particularly easy to estimate traffic from the available data. Daily average travel times are only available for a single, selected route at a time, and for a maximum of three months per download. The restrictions make sense, but are a little inconvenient. To get around this, I chose one route through the centre of my city of interest and decided to use this as a rough measure - longer travel times would hopefully translate to days with heavier traffic. To get better estimates, one could repeat this for many different routes to improve the metric.\n\nAverage uber ride travel times - a rough proxy for traffic conditions?\nI initially selected Nairobi for my investigation, since Uber data is available there and it seemed like air quality data was available as well. However, looking more closely at the air quality data revealed that it is sparse and there was almost none available for the dates that uber movement data had been gathered. So, with regret, I moved my initial exploration to the States, where air quality data has been gathered in many locations for decades - just one more way in which Africa lags behind in terms of data availability.\nI chose Pittsburgh, since it seemed as good a place as any when I looked at the list of cities with Uber Movement data. As before, I picked a route through town and downloaded the average daily travel times from movement.uber.com. To get the air quality data, I turned to Google Bigquery. The following code pulls the relevant data from the giant (&gt;1GB) dataset:\n\nQuerying the epa historical air quality dataset\nThe resultant 1MB csv can be downloaded and loaded into a pandas dataframe for analysis. Combining it with the uber data meant it was time for the moment of truth: is there a correlation between travel times (as a measure of traffic intensity) and air quality? Let’s plot the two:\n\nAir quality (X axis) vs mean travel times (y axis)\nIf anything, there was a tiny negative correlation. But the main issue is the quality of the data. A single route is probably not a good metric for traffic as a whole. Less than a year’s worth of data is not great. This ignores co-factors such as weather. Etc, etc. Can we do better?"

Including badly spelled Reddit rants (for text models), or low-quality PowerPoint screenshots (for image models). For text-to-image models, another aspect of ‘high-quality’ data is image-caption alignment. If captions don’t match images very well, the model will learn to rely less on the prompt when generating. The fix is to continue training on ‘better’ data, to bias the model toward generating the good stuff. You’re not necessarily teaching it much new in this stage - just pushing it towards a subset of the possibilities it could already generate.\n\nSD 1.5 trained on ~1B samples - “A professional photo of an astronaut riding a horse on the moon”\n\nSD1.5 fine-tuned on ~1M ‘good’ samples\nFor a model like ChatGPT, this step involves manually finding or creating high-quality examples of chat dialogs. For something like Midjourney, it presumably involves collecting a dataset of stunning-looking images and making sure they have good captions (either by filtering out existing captions or by using auto-generated captions). Next time you read about a cool new generative model, keep an eye out for mention of this ‘high-quality fine tune’ step. For example, in this post on the new Kandinsky 2.1 text-to-image model, they note that after training on a large dataset “Further, at the stage of fine-tuning, a dataset of 2M very high-quality high-resolution images with descriptions … was used separately collected from open sources.”"

However, successful products require pleasing users, so making sure the model creates things that users like is a big deal. Midjourney is a great example - they’ve been collecting user feedback since day 1, and presumably using said feedback to improve their models. Apart from explicit ratings, there are also other ways to get user feedback - for example, when a user selects one of four possible images to download or upscale they provide a signal that can be used to estimate their preference:\nhttps://twitter.com/johnowhitaker/status/1640608207730081792?s=20\nThe exact method for incorporating this feedback varies. For text, the standard approach is to do something called “Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback” (RLHF) where a large number of human-labeled outputs are used to train a ‘reward model’ that scores a given generation. This model is then used to train the generative model, evaluating its outputs and providing a signal which is then used to update the model such that it produces better ones according to the reward model. You could also use this kind of preference model to filter out low-quality data (feeding back into (2)) or to condition your model on quality, such that at inference time you can simply ask for 10/10 generations! Whatever the method used, this final stage is once again not teaching the model anything new but is instead ‘aligning’ the model such that its outputs more often look like something humans will like."

That said, I feel like this year we’re seeing it really pay dividends as apps like ChatGPT reach hundreds of millions of people and companies scramble to offer free access to powerful models in exchange for that all-important user preference data. Excitingly, there are open-source efforts to collect the necessary data too - see the PickAPic effort (for images) or the Open Assistant project (for chat data) among many others. And open source models such as stable diffusion let others skip the expensive pre-training phase and move straight to fine-tuning, lowering the barrier to entry substantially."

You see this with images - anything trained on early user preferences for text-to-image models is likely to skew toward fantasy women and art-station aesthetics.

    "text": "I wanted to write this up to show how easy it is becoming to test ideas and find interesting trends in data. Please don’t draw too many conclusions from the numbers here - pinch of salt and all that.\nYesterday I came across the Wellcome Trust Data Re-Use Prize: Maleria. They have made tons of data available, and invited participants to generate a new insight, tool or health application from that data. Incredible to see such great initiatives.\nBrowsing through the data, one map in particular drew my attention - the ‘Residual Means’. These “show the remaining (residual) transmission that has not been accounted for by the covariates already in the model.” Doesn’t that smell juicy?\nExplaining this unattributed transmission is one of the example questions provided. It would be neat to see if we can figure out why malaria infection rates are higher than expected in some areas, and lower in others.\nI was looking at all this as I procrastinated some work I’m doing mapping baobab trees. It occurred to me that it wouldn’t be completely absurd to see if there is any relation between the two subjects. Now you’ll just have to take my word on this for now, but rest assured that I have a decently accurate map of baobab tree density for Zimbabwe and surrounds. I quickly downloaded the residuals maps and fired up QGIS to take a look.\n\nThis isn’t the density map I used, but it is similar and looks prettier\nEstimating correlation by looking at two maps and saying “there seems to be some patterns here” is not an established scientific practice, but it is fun to see the brains pattern-matching functions get abused. After a few minutes the fun wore off and I got down to the serious business. I want to see if there is a correlation between baobab density (or rather, access to baobab fruit) and malerial transmission/infection.\nStackoverflow “get raster value at point” since it’s been a while. Wow - I don’t even have the gdal toolbox on this laptop yet! Technical hurdles out of the way, I threw together some code:\n\nFull code listing on Github \nCreating regularly spaced points over the area of interest (i.e. the area I have baobab densities for), I use the above code to sample the baobab density and the transmission residual at each point. Next, we check to see if they’re correlated:\nscipy.stats.pearsonr(densities, maleria_residuals) yields a correlation coefficient of -0.1226401351031383, p=0. That is, places with more baobabs have less unattributed transmission than places without. To show this visually, let’s look at a scatter plot of the two variables:\n\nScatter plot - unattributed transmission vs baobab density\nPlaces with high baobab density have inexplicably low transmission rates, in general. In fact, 86% of locations with estimated baobab density &gt;10 trees/hectare had a negative ‘unattributed transmission’ value.\nAt this point, my half-hour break should have ended, but I was interested. I had mainly done asked the question as an exercise in seeing how easy it was to play with the data. But there was a correlation (note: correlation != causation). Now it could well be that baobab trees and malaria transmission are both dependent on some of the same environmental factors, some of which might not have been taken into account by the model. But could it be the case that this wonderful tree (I’m a little biased) might be doing some good?\nBaobab fruit is good for you [1]. It’s got lots of minerals and vitamins, and my initial hunch was that maybe, just maybe, it could be boosting the health of any community who lives close to the trees. Another angle came up when I looked for sources for [1] and found references to the use of baobab in traditional medicine as a treatment for malaria [2, 3]. Now curious, I looked around and found a study [4] suggesting “that Adansonia digitata protects against Plasmodium berghei induced-malaria, and that administration of the extract after established infection reduced malaria progression.” (in mice - from the [4]).\nTo sum up, we’ve looked at the malaria data and found that there are some variations in the transmission rates that the current models can’t explain. We’ve then examined the relationship between baobab tree density and malaria transmission residuals and noted that there is a small negative correlation. We’ve seen that areas with baobabs present tend to have lower transmission rates than expected, and presented the idea that this could be due to the health benefits of the fruit or the anti-malarial properties of the bark, which is often used in traditional medicine. All done, thank you very much, can I has my PhD yet?\nScience isn’t quite that easy. I share this story to show how rapidly you can start generating hypotheses and playing with data. But to give a rigorous answer will take a little more than an hour coding and an hour smugly writing a blog post. I can think of a few reasons why the results here should be taken with a large pinch of salt, and I leave it as an exercise for the reader to list a whole bunch more. Hopefully soon I’ll have time for a follow-up, doing it properly and explaining how one should actually go about it.\nFor now, cheers\nReferences\n[1] - I had some sources, but it’s more entertaining if you google ‘baobab superfruit’ and then ignore the most enthusiastic 90% of results.

    "text": "What is NBDev?\nLike many, I started my programming journey editing scripts in Notepad. Then I discovered the joy of IDEs with syntax highlighting, and life got better. I tried many editors over the years, benefiting from better debugging, code completion, stylish themes… But essentially, they all offer the same workflow: write code in an editor, run it and see what happens, make some changes, repeat. Then came Jupyter notebooks. Inline figures and explanations. Interactivity! Suddenly you don’t need to re-run everything just to try something new. You can work in stages, seeing the output of each stage before coding the next step. For some tasks, this is a major improvement. I found myself using them more and more, especially as I drifted into Data Science.\nBut what about when you want to deploy code? Until recently, my approach was to experiment in Jupyter, and then copy and paste code into a separate file or files which would become my library or application. This caused some friction - which is where NBDev comes in.\n~~~~~ “Create delightful python projects using Jupyter Notebooks” - NBDev website ~~~~~\nWith NBDev, everything happens in your notebooks. By adding special comments like #export to the start of a cell, you tell NBDev how to treat the code. This means you can write a function that will be exported, write some examples to illustrate how it works, plot the results and surround it with nice explanations in markdown. The exported code gets paces in a neat, well-ordered .py file that becomes your final product. The Notebook(s) becomes documentation, and the extra examples you added to show functionality work as tests (although you can also add more formal unit testing). An extra line of code uploads your library for others to install with pip. And if you’re following their guide, you get a documentation site and continuous integration that updates whenever you push your changes to GitHub.\nThe upshot of all this is that you can effortlessly create good, clean code and documentation without having to switch between notebooks, editors and separate documentation. And the process you followed, the journey that lead to the final design choices, is no longer hidden. You can show how things developed, and include experiments that justify a particular choice. This is ‘literate programming’, and it feels like a major shift in the way I think about software development. I could wax lyrical about this for ages, but you should just go and read about it in the launch post here."

    "text": "What on Earth is Swoggle?\nChristmas, 2019. Our wedding has brought a higher-than-normal influx of relatives to Cape Town, and when this extended family gets together, there are some things that are inevitable. One of these, it turns out, is the invention of new games to keep the cousins entertained. And thus, Swoggle was born :)\n\nA Swoggle game in progress - 2 players are left.\nThe game is played on an 8x8 board. There are usually 4 players, each with a base in one of the corners. Players can move (a dice determines how far), “spoggle” other players (capturing them and placing them in “swoggle spa” - none of this violent termnology) or ‘swoggle’ a base (gently retiring the bases owner from the game - no killing here). To make things interesting, there are four ‘drones’ that can be used as shields or to take an occupied base. Moving with a drone halves the distance you can travel, to make up for the advantages. A player with a drone can’t be spoggled by another player unless they too have a drone, or they ‘powerjump’ from their base (a half-distance move) onto the droned player. Maybe I’ll make a video one day and explain the rules properly :)\nSo, that’s the game. Each round is fairly quick, so we usually play multiple rounds, awarding points for different achievements. Spoggling (capturing) a player: 1 point. Swoggling (taking out a base): 3 points. Last one standing: 5 points. The dice rolls add lots of randomness, but there is still plenty of room for tactics, sibling rivalry and comedic mistakes."

These cells are grouped in a Board, which represents the game grid and tracks the spa. The Board class also contains some useful methods like is_valid_move() and ways to move a particular player around. At the highest level, I have a Swoggle class that wraps a board, handles setting up the initial layout, provides a few extra convenience functions and can be used to run a game manually or with some combination of agents (which we’ll cover in the next section). Since I’m working in NBDev, I have some docs with almost no effort, so check out https://johnowhitaker.github.io/swoggle/ for details on this implementation. Here’s what the documentation system turned my notebooks into:\n\nPart of the generated documentation\nThe ability to write code and comments in a notebook, and have that turn into a swanky docs page, is borderline magical.

It would also be useful to have a few non-RL agents to test things out and, later, to act as opponents for my fancier bots. I implemented two types of agent:\n\nRandomAgent Simply picks a random but valid move by trial and error, and makes that move.\nBasicAgent Adds a few simple heuristics. If it can take a base, it does so. If it can spoggle a player, it does so. If neither of these options are possible, it moves randomly.\n\nYou can see the agent code here. The notebook also defines a few other useful functions, such as win_rates() to pit different agents against each-other and see how they do. This is fun to play with - after a few experiments it’s obvious that the board layout and order of players matters a lot. A BasicAgent going last will win ~62% of games against three RandomAgents - not unexpected. But of the three RandomAgents, the one opposite the BasicAgent (and thus furthest from it) will win the majority of the remaining games."

However, the competition is focused on a single year (2017), while the composite image likely drew data from previous years. And, with a single composite image, any growth cycles or seasonal variation between the different crops is lost. This leads to our first major improvement: using images from different times of year and combining them into one input image that preserves the seasonal changes.\n\nBest quality landsat imagery from Jan-March 2017, one of the new model inputs\nThe new Earth Engine code filters the available Landsat imagery by date, splitting it into 4-month sections. The earliest high-quality imagery from each time period is selected (based on the code in this guide). Once this step is complete, the images are combined int a single new image that maintains the bands from each. The result is an image with 28 bands, which will be sampled and used by the model.\n\nMerging the images into one\nUsing the resultant merged image in place of the greenest-pixel composite, a CART classifier now achieves an accuracy of 76% on the training data, and scores 16.56 on the test data - an improvement over our previous score for this model. A randomForest classifier with 100 trees does even better, bringing the score down to 13.56, our new best."

Instead of submitting to Zindi to get a score (limited to 5 a day), we need a way to compare models locally, ideally with the same metric the contest uses. Fortunately, they’re open about the scoring method - it’s based on log-loss. By splitting the training data, using part to train a model and the rest to test it, we can get a rough idea of what out model would score:\n\nScoring a model with log_loss\nThe score depends on the test/train split. For better accuracy, we can average the scores with several different test/train splits. With a scoring method in place, we can start optimizing our models. As an example, we can pick the number of trees to use with the random forest model by plotting how the scores change with more estimators. In this case, anything above 200 looks to provide minimal extra advantage.\n\nWith Random Forest bottoming out at ~1.4 after some tweaking, I turned to XGBoost. A nice summary of tuning XGBoost can be found here. Starting with some suggested values and tweaking the max_depth and learning_rate parameters led me to a model that scored 1.15 in my tests - enough of an improvement that I made a submission using it’s predictions on Zindi. Score: 1.51. Pretty much the same as the Random Forest model."

If I try any of these, I’ll update this post.\nFor now, however, I am content. We’ve seen that it is possible to perform the specified task (crop identification) using nothing but some free Landsat data in GEE and some open source libraries to do the ML heavy lifting. While the fancy imagery provided is no doubt useful (see the top scores as evidence of this), this exercise shows that it is not essential to this kind of analysis. I hope that it inspires some of you to see what else is possible."

My name is Jonathan Whitaker. I’m an Electrical Engineer with a Data Science background, currently pursuing some personal research projects while my wife and I take a working vacation around Zimbabwe. For the last 5 years I’ve been writing code to solve problems. Big, important problems for work. Small, interesting projects for fun. Obscure, not-quite-problems because something bugged me and I thought “I can do that better”. I’m hoping that this blog will become a place for me to share these solutions and associated musings.\nI’ve called the blog ’The Data Science Cast-net”. This is because I have developed a fairly chronic case of something I call the data science mindset - something I try to instil in my students when I teach this stuff. In essence, this is a mental practice of looking at pretty much everything as a data science problem. Looking for somewhere to live? I can map travel times, house prices, crime rates etc to efficiently narrow down the search. Idly wondering how a romantic relationship is affecting your health? Google Fit makes all sorts of data available - we can compare different years and do some fun statistics to see if you’re walking more or less now that you’re hitched. And so on, down a slippery slope that ends with you tracking all aspects of your life and thinking in terms of variables and models far too often. Now, armed with the tools to make sense of data, I am throwing my cast-net out into the world and seeing what interesting information-fish I can pull in.\nI look forward to sharing this experiment with you."

Each feature in the training shapefile contains a property, ‘Crop_Id_Ne’, that tells us the crop type. Unfortunately, this is represented as a string.

But as AI researchers we often work on things that involve a lot of moving pieces, and when something doesn’t work it can be hard to find out where the issue(s) may be, let alone what we need to do to fix them. I think of these tasks as having a high “surface area”, and in this post I’ll share a few tips for dealing with these inspired by a recent experience with one such problem."

For example, rather than using Llama-2-7B with LoRA adapters, I did some early tests with a network made of blocks like this:\nclass Block(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, size=512):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        # Trainable layer\n        self.l1 = torch.nn.Linear(size, size)\n\n        # Frozen layer\n        self.l2 = torch.nn.Linear(size, size)\n                for param in self.l2.parameters():\n            param.requires_grad = False\nStarting small lets you add bits of complexity one at a time, gradually revealing different aspects of the problem. With this small example I could experiment with and isolate specific aspects of the larger challenge - for example, swapping out one linear layer with a quantized version. The goal here is to reduce the surface area that is in focus at a given time, and incrementally add more as we figure things out."

Printing the memory use at different stages helped show that something funky was going on, but it was only through a combination of memory profiling and a minimal example that I was able to spot the issue. I hadn’t used this memory visualization tool before - it’s only a few months old, and I hadn’t heard of it until a colleague suggested it.

    "text": "Tip 4: Refactor repeatedly to surface + eliminate complexity where possible\nSoftware complexity tends to grow over time. Features get added, chunks of code get split into different files and made more modular, options proliferate as more and more configurations are supported… All of this may be perfectly reasonable, but can make it difficult to understand a specific circumstance. Focusing on one task and bringing as much of the code as possible into a single notebook or python file can be a great tool for debugging, forcing you to read the important bits as they get refactored out of their silos and into your new version.\nYou may worry that the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are beyond you. Worry not! Beneath all the layers there are almost always fairly simple pieces. For example, consider the case of applying LoRA adapters to a model. I had to do this for a video I was making on diffusion models. The diffusers library implementation spans multiple layers of abstractions and is stuffed with conditions to handle different formats and approaches. It was only when I extracted out and re-wrote the key step that I could properly understand it and begin to experiment.\n\n\n\nMerging in LoRA weights in a diffusion model pipeline: minimal implementation compared to the &gt;300LOC diffusers version. Theirs supports far more options, but for experimenting + debugging a minimal re-implementation was far easier to work with and understand. Once things are working, we can always switch back to the more complicated ‘official’ version.\n\n\nIdeally, start from some minimal example and build up from there. Your final result doesn’t need to be a permanent artefact, but having everything in one place when working on especially thorny problems is extremely useful. This is a skill that is hard to learn from examining others’ code, since we typically only get a look at the final result. Notebooks can be a great way to share the progression as you verify things a few lines at a time before combining them into larger blocks, but even here we usually see just the final (working) version rather than all the intermediate pieces."

    "text": "In the previous two posts, we built a Species Distribution Model and used it to predict the density of Baobab trees in Zimbabwe. Then we tried some more complex models, trained a decision tree regressor and imported it into Google Earth Engine. We showed various metrics of how well a model does, but ended with an open question: how to we tell how well the model will do when looking at a completely new area? This is the subject we’ll tackle in today’s post.\nThe key concept here is distance from the sample space. We sampled at a limited number of geographic locations, but there is no way these locations completely cover all possible combinations of temperature, rainfall, soil type and altitude. For example, all samples were at altitudes between 300 and 1300m above sea level. We might expect a model to make reasonable predictions for a new point at 500m above sea level. But what about a point at 290m elevation? Or 2000m? Or sea level? Fitting a linear model based purely on altitude, we see the problem clearly:\n\nLine of best fit: Elevation vs Density\nNegative tree densities at high altitude? Insanely high densities at sea level? Clearly, extrapolating beyond our sample space is risky. Incidentally, if it looks to you like there are two Gaussian distributions there in the data you are not alone - they might correspond to the two types* of baobabs found on mainland Africa. Until recently, conventional wisdom held that there is only one species present, and this is still contested. See a related paper I worked on here [1]. A more complex model might help, but that’s besides the point. A model’s predictions are only valid for inputs that are close enough to the training data for extrapolation to make sense.\nSo how do we deal with this? A simple approach might be to define upper and lower bounds for all input variables and to avoid making predictions outside of the range covered by our training data. We can do this in GEE using masking:\n\nBlack areas fall within 80% bounds for all variables\nThis is a reasonable approach - it stops us doing much dangerous extrapolating outside our sample space and has the added benefit of clearly conveying the limitations of the model. But we can do better. Imagine an area that is almost identical to some of our training data, but differs in a few attributes. Now further imagine that none of these attributes matter much to baobabs, and in any case they are only just below our thresholds. Surely we can expect a prediction in this area to have some value? We need a way to visualise how far away a point is from our sample space, so that we can infer how bad our predictions for that point are likely to be.\nEnter what I call the |Weighted Distance Vector|. We represent each input as a dimension. We consider how far away a point is from our sample space along each dimension, and compute the vector sum of these distances. I say the ‘weighted’ sum since we can scale the distance on each axis to reflect the relative importance of that variable, attaching higher weight to variables with larger effects on the output. Let’s clarify with an example.\nConsidering only two variables, elevation and temperature, we can represent all our training data as points (blue) on a grid where the X axis represents elevation and the y axis temperature. We’ll draw out our limits around the training data using bounds covering 90% of our data. A point within the limits has a |WDV| of 0. Now consider a point outside the limits (red). It’s 250m higher than any we’ve seen - 0.25 times the range of elevations observed. It’s 2.5 degrees cooler than any of our sampled locations, which is 0.3 times the upper-lower bounds for temperature. The distance is sqrt(0.25^2 +0.3^2) = 0.39. However, altitude has a large influence on distribution, while temperature does not. Scaling by appropriate weights (see the penultimate paragraph for where these come from) we get |WDV| = sqrt((0.173*0.25)^2 +(0.008*0.3)^2) = 0.043. The key point here is that the |WDV| captures the fact that elevation is important. A point at 750m elevation with a mean temp of 30 °C will have a low |WDV| (0.005), while one with a mean temp of 23 °C but an altitude of 1600m will have a high |WDV| (0.02).\n\nA point outside our sampled region\nTo do this in GEE is fairly simple, since we can map functions over the input images to get the |WDV| at each location. This script shows it in action. And the result gives us much more information than the mask we made earlier. Red areas have a very small |WDV|, and we expect our model to do well there. White areas are out of scope, and I’d take predictions in the yellow regions with a grain of salt. What isn’t included here is geographical distance - extrapolating to different continents, even if conditions match, is not advised.\n\n|WDV| over Southern Africa. Red areas are similar to sampled regions, white are not.\nOne thing I’ve glossed over so far: how do we get the weights used? I defined the |WDV| as weighted because we “scale the distance on each axis to reflect the relative importance of that variable.” The feature weights can be thumb-sucked by an expert (I’ve seen this done) but the easiest way to get reasonable weights is to look at the model.feature_importances_ variable of a trained random forest regressor. In the process of fitting the model, the relative importance of each input feature is computed, so we get this info for free if we’ve done the modelling as described in Part 2. Another option would be to use the correlation coefficients of each input var with the density. I leave that as an exercise for the reader.\nSo there you go - a way to visualise how applicable a model is in different locations, using weighted distance from sample space as a metric. In the next post of this series I’ll share the method I’m using to expand our sample space and get a model that can produce useful predictions over a much wider area. Before then, I’m going to take a break from baobabs and write up some other, smaller experiments I’ve been doing. See you then!\n*I’m using ‘type’ instead of ‘species’ here, because while the genetics are contentious, it is fairly clear that there are at least two kinds of baobabs here.\n[1] - Douie, C., Whitaker, J. and Grundy, I., 2015.

One popular method is to look at how much light is being emitted there at night - as my 3 regular readers may remember, there is a great nighttime lights dataset produced by NOAA that was featured in a data glimpse a while back. It turns out that the amount of light sent out does correlate with metrics such as assets and consumption, and this data has been used in the past to model things like economic activity (see another data glimpse post for more that). One problem with this approach: the low end of the scale gets tricky - nighttime lights don’t vary much below a certain level of expenditure.\nLooking at daytime imagery, we see many things that might help tell us about the wealth in a place: type of roofing material on the houses, the number of roads, how built-up an area is…. But there’s a problem here too: these features are quite complicated, and training data is sparse. We could try to train a deep learning model to take in imagery and spit out income level, but the LSMS surveys typically only cover a few hundred locations - not a very large dataset, in other words."

This multi-step transfer learning approach did very well, and is a technique that’s definitely worth keeping in mind when you’re facing a problem without much data.\nBut wait, you say. How is this better than just using nightlights? From the article: “How might a model partially trained on an imperfect proxy for economic well-being—in this case, the nightlights used in the second training step above—improve upon the direct use of this proxy as an estimator of well-being? Although nightlights display little variation at lower expenditure levels (Fig. 1, C to F), the survey data indicate that other features visible in daytime satellite imagery, such as roofing material and distance to urban areas, vary roughly linearly with expenditure (fig. S2) and thus better capture variation among poorer clusters. Because both nightlights and these features show variation at higher income levels, training on nightlights can help the CNN learn to extract features like these that more capably capture variation across the entire consumption distribution.” (Jean et al, 2016). So the model learns expenditure-dependent features that are useful even at the low end, overcoming the issue faced by approaches that use nightlights alone. Too clever!"

I’ve gone a step further and consolidated everything into a single Google Colab notebook that borrows code from the above and builds on it. The rest of this post will explain the different sections of the notebook, and why I depart from the exact method used in the paper.

The notebook shows how to read in several of the CSV files downloaded from the website, and combine them into ‘clusters’ - see below. For each cluster location, we have a unique ID (HHID), a location (lat and lon), an urban/rural indicator, a weighting for statisticians, and the important variable: consumption (cons). This last one is the thing we’ll be trying to predict.\n\nThe relevant info from the survey data\nOne snag: the lat and lon columns are tricksy! They’ve been shifted to protect anonymity, so we’ll have to consider a 10km buffer around the given location and hope the true location is close enough that we get useful info."

We can get the nightlights for each cluster location (getting the mean over an 8km buffer around the lat/lon points) and add this number as a column.

Details are in the notebook. The code takes several hours to run, but at the end of it you’ll have thousands of images ready to use.\n\nTracking requests/sec on in my Google Cloud Console\nYou’ll notice that I only generate 20 locations around each cluster. The original paper uses 100. Reasons: 1) I’m impatient. 2) There is a rate limit of 25k images/day, and I didn’t want to wait (see #1), 3) The images are 400 x 400, but are then shrunk to train the model. I figured I could split the 400px image into 4 (or 9) smaller images that overlap slightly, and thus get more training data for free. This is suggested as a “TO TRY” in the notebook, but hint: it works. If you really wanted to get a better score, trying this or adding more imagery is an easy way to do so."

The results:\n\nScore using just nightlights (baseline): 0.33\nScore with features extracted from imagery: 0.41\n\nUsing just the features derived from the imagery, we got a significant score increase. We’ve successfully used deep learning to squeeze some useful information out of satellite imagery, and in the process found a way to get better predictions of survey outcomes such as consumption.

It would be nice to have some sort of model that can interpret satellite imagery well already and go straight to the results.\nDownloading from Google Static Maps is a major bottleneck. I used only 20 images / cluster for this blog - to do 100 per cluster and for multiple countries would take weeks, and to extend predictions over Africa months. There is also patchy availability in some areas.\n\nSo, I’ve been experimenting with using Sentinel 2 imagery, which is freely available for download over large areas and comes with 13 bands over a wide spectrum of wavelengths. The resolution is lower, but the imagery still has lots of useful info. There are also large, labeled datasets like the EuroSAT database that have allowed people to pretrain models and achieve state of the art results for tasks like land cover classification. I’ve taken advantage of this by using a model pre-trained on this imagery for land cover classification tasks (using all 13 bands) and re-training it for use in the consumption prediction task we’ve just been looking at. I’ve been able to basically match the results we got above using only a single Sentinel 2 image for each cluster.\nUsing Sentinel imagery solves both my concerns - we can get imagery for an entire country, and make predictions for large areas, at different dates, without needing to rely on Google’s Static Maps API.

And a respiratory virus sweeping the globe has brought forward discussions around lung health and pollution, and the health burden associated with exposure to unhealthy levels of pollutants. There are thousands of air quality sensors around the world, but if you view a map of these sensors, it’s painfully obvious that some areas are underserved, with a marked lack of data:\n\nAir Quality from sensors around the world. Source: https://waqi.info/\nThe ‘gap in the map’ was the motivation for a weekend hackathon hosted through Zindi, which challenged participants to build a model capable of predicting air quality (specifically PM25 concentration) based on available satellite and weather data.\nThe hackathon was a success, and was enough of a proof-of-concept that we decided to put a little more work into taking the results and turning them into something useful. Myself and Yasin Ayami spent a bit of time re-creating the initial data preparation phase (pulling the data from the Sentinel 5P satellite data collections in Google Earth Engine, creating a larger training set of known air quality readings etc) and then we trained a model inspired by the winning solutions that is able to predict historical air quality with a mean absolute error of less than 20.\n\nDashboard for exploring air quality across Africa (http://www.datasciencecastnet.com/airq/)\nA full report along with notebooks and explanation can be found in this GitHub repository. But the good news is that you don’t need to re-create the whole process if you’d just like a look at the model outputs - those predictions are available in the repository as well. For example, to get the predictions for major cities across Africa you can download and explore this CSV file. And if you don’t want to download anything, I’ve also made a quick dashboard to show the data, both as a time-series for whatever city you want to view and as a map showing the average for all the locations.\nI’ve tagged this post as a ‘Data Glimpse’ since the details are already written up elsewhere :) I hope it’s of interest, and as always let me know if you have any questions around this.

The course was originally delivered over Discord, but you can access recordings of the lessons on YouTube alongside Colab Notebooks containing the code and examples.\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23FjyM69j910zCdDFVWcjSIKHbSB7NE8\nThe experience of putting this together and sharing it was highly enjoyable. I always get a kick out of seeing my code or teaching being used by other people to make cool stuff, and our Discord server is a steady stream of fun projects and experiments that make me so happy.\nIf I had to distil a few key takeaways I’ve gained from this endeavour, they would be\n\nOptimization is magic. Set things up so that  uses  to produce  which can be evaluated against  in a differentiable way, and suddenly you can iteratively update those parameters bit by bit until (if all goes well) you achieve said goal. The secret here is that code for updating an image to look more like a description is practically identical to the code for updating the parameters of a neural network to solve some complicated task. And so while we were busy making art, everyone was secretly learning the much broader skill of solving problems with optimization :)\nYou don’t need a PhD to dabble with deep learning. Quite a few students had been playing with various AI art models but hadn’t been able to dig in and understand the code or inner workings. But once we started building up from simple examples, it suddenly ‘clicked’ and what was previously intimidating walls of code became fancier versions of the patterns we’d already seen again and again.\nI really like teaching. Seeing that ‘aha’ moment makes me so happy - I’m going to have to find ways to do more of this :)\nPeople are SO COOL! I love seeing how different people can see the same material and get inspired to create wildly different things.\nAI art is SO COOL! We’re still at the beginning of this movement, but already there are such powerful and amazing models and techniques available to us. With a little bit of tinkering you cna learn how to make them sing, and the results can be simply stunning. I look forward to seeing where the next few generations of tech take us.\n\nAnyway, that’s about all I have for this post. Check out the videos or come and hang out in the discord to see what we’re playing with next, and stay tuned since I might turn this V1 course into something a little more polished over the Christmas holidays.

    "text": "What is CLOOB-Conditioned Latent Diffusion?\nDiffusion models are getting a lot of fame at the moment thanks to GLIDE and DALL-E 2 which have recently rocked the internet with their astounding text-to-image capabilities. They are trained by gradually adding noise to an input image over a series of steps, and having the network predict how to ‘undo’ this process. If we start from pure noise and have the network progressively try to ‘fix’ the image we eventually end up with a nice looking output (if all is working well).\n\nAn illustration of this kind of model from the website related to one of the key papers that first outlined this idea.\nTo add text-to-image capacity to these models, they are often ‘conditioned’ on some representation of the captions that go along with the images. That is, in addition to seeing a noisy image, they also get an encoding of the text describing the image to help in the de-noising step. Starting from noise again but this time giving a description of the desired output image as the text conditioning ideally steers the network towards generating an image that matches the description.\n\nCLOOB architecture diagram (from the project page - which is worth a read!)\nDownsides: these diffusion models are computationally intensive to train, and require images with text labels. Latent diffusion models reduce the computational requirements by doing the denoising in the latent space of an autoencoder rather than on images directly. And since CLOOB maps both images and text to the same space, we can substitute the CLOOB encodings of the image itself in place of actual caption encodings if we want to train with unlabelled images. A neat trick if you ask me!\nThe best non-closed text-to-image implementation at the moment is probably the latent diffusion model trained by the CompVis team, which you can try out here."

One of the main things we were curious about was how the resulting model would be different from the one we started with, which was trained on a much larger and more diverse set of images. Has it ‘overfit’ to the point of being unuseable? How much more ‘arty’ do the results look when passing descriptions that don’t necessarily suggest fine art? And has fine-tuning on a relatively ‘clean’ dataset lowered the ability of the model to produce disturbing outputs? To answer these questions, we generated hundreds of images with both models.\n\n\n\nGenerated images from the prompts ‘winter landscape’, ‘autumn landscape’ and ‘spring landscape’ (WikiArt model). Note: all results are ‘painterly’ despite no allusion to paintings or art in the prompts. Seeds kept consistent for each set - note the slight similarity in overall structure for corresponding images.\nI’ve moved the side-by-side comparisons to a gallery at the end of this post. These were the key takeaways for me:\n\nStarting from a ‘photorealistic’ autoencoder didn’t stop it from making very painterly outputs. This was useful - we thought we might have to train our own autoencoder first as well.\nThe type of output definitely shifted, almost everything it makes looks like a painting\nIt lost a lot of more general concepts but does really well with styles/artists/image types present in the dataset. So landscape paintings are great, but ‘a frog’ is not going to give anything recognizable and ‘an avocado armchair’ is a complete fail :)\nIt may have over-fit, and this seems to have made it much less likely to generate disturbing content (at the expense of also being bad at a lot of other content types)."

I’ll spare you the code (it’s available in this GitHub repo) but I pulled in travel times from Uber Movement, and added them as an extra column. The test data looks the same, but lacks the ‘Count’ column - the thing we’re trying to predict. Normally you’d have to do extra processing: encoding the categorical columns, scaling the numerical features… luckily, catboost makes it very easy:\n\nTraining the model\nThis is convenient, and that would be enough reason to try this model first. As a bonus, they’ve implemented all sorts of goodness under the hood to do with categorical variable encoding, performance improvements etc. My submission (which took half an hour to implement) achieved a score of 4.21 on the test data, which beats about 75% of the leaderboard. And this is with almost no tweaking! If I spent ages adding features, playing with model parameters etc, I have no doubt this could come close to the winning submissions.\nIn conclusion, I think this is definitely a tool worth adding to my arsenal. It isn’t magic, but for quick solutions it seems to give good performance out-of-the-box and simplifies data prep - a win for me.\nThis was a short post since I’m hoping to carry on working on the AI Art contest - expect more from that tomorrow!"

To get around this, some folks are turning to smaller subsets of ImageNet for early experimentation - if something works well in small scale tests, *then* we can try it in the big leagues. Leading this trend have been Jeremy Howard and the fastai team, who often use ImageNette (10 easy classes from ImageNet), ImageWoof (Some dog breeds from ImageNet) and most recently Image网 (‘ImageWang’, 网 being ‘net’ in Chinese).\nImage网 contains some images from both ImageNette and ImageWoof, but with a twist: only 10% of the images are labeled to use for training. The remainder are in a folder, unsup, specifically for use in unsupervised learning. We’ll be using this dataset to try our hand at self-supervised learning, using the unlabeled images to train our network on a pretext task before trying classification."

This is a new enough field that new ideas are being tried all the time, and I believe that a key skill in the future will be coming up with pretext tasks in different domains. For images, there are some options explained well in this fastai blog. Options include:\n\nColorization of greyscale images\nClassifying corrupted images\nImage In-painting (filling in ‘cutouts’ in the image)\nSolving jigsaws\n\nFor fun, I came up with a variant of the image in-painting task that combines it with colorization. Several sections of the input image are blurred and turned greyscale. The network tries to replace these regions with sensible values, with the goal being to have the output match the original image as closely as possible. One reason I like the idea of this as a pretext task is that we humans get something similar. Each time we move our eyes, things that were in our blurry, greyscale peripheral vision are brought into sharp focus in our central vision - another input for the part of our brain that’s been pretending they were full HD color the whole time :)\nHere are some examples of the grey-blurred images and the desired outputs:\n\nInput/Output pairs for our pretext task, using the RandomGreyBlur transform\nWe train our network on this task for 15 epochs, and then save its parameters for later use in the downstream task.

This step can be quite tedious, but the 5-epoch models are enough to show that we’ve made an improvement on the baseline, which is pretty exciting. For training runs 20 epochs and greater, we still beat a baseline with no pre-training, but fall behind the current leaderboard entry based on simple inpainting. There is much tweaking to be done, and the runs take ~1 minute per epoch, so I’ll update this when I have more results."

Nathaniel Ruiz of dream Booth and ziplora among many others supervised. The results are amazing but the paper is almost impossible to understand. Far too much technical jargon and acronyms. I did not bother trying to go deep on it. The tldr is something like ‘we mess with the attention to include features from the style or content images and we have a way of disentangling the two. The features are somehow persist separately and then combined allowing us to reweight things or adjust how and where the influence from content or style applies’. But there is also lots of nonsense about optimal control and stochastic bloody blast.\n\n\n\nPrism: very fun work that is similar in some ways to anthropics sparse Auto encoders work. It identifies vectors or directions in feature space or in embedding space. If you will that are that that represents atomic concepts around language and then explores using these to edit text. So for example, they identify some semantic directions like casual/formal or becoming a question or whatever, and then have a auto encoder style thing that can take in some text and produce a vector and then produce text from that vector and then they find ways to edit the embedding based on these identified features. So you could for example, make some text more formal or make it a question instead of a statement. There’s a lot in the post that I didn’t go into too deeply, but it seems like a very nice exploration of practical applications for the kind of mechanistic interpretability stuff we looked at with andthics paper. I look forward to his future work\nGemma 2. Technical report the Gemma 2 model is a sizable improvement over the original Gemma model. The 9B now seems like the best in its weight class beating out Llama 3 8b. The 27b version is almost as good as llama 70B on some measures the best in its size class, but also unclear if it is with it to move from Llama 3 70B for the kinds of applications, this would be used for. Interestingly, they explored distillation as a training process for the smaller models. At least they found a substantial boost compared to normal pre-training. They also did model averaging where they took the SFT version and the RLHF version and averaged the weights. Overall the model looks pretty decent. Nothing too crazy. Architecture wise they used grouped query attention, mix of local and global attention. It seems like a pretty efficient and performant model.\nSakana’s LLM Squared: Using llms to evolve codes to train. LLMs sounds very fancy and futuristic, but I was a little bit underwhelmed by what they actually did. Even though it was still pretty cool. They are using llms as code mutation to “evolve” the loss function for something like DPO so preference optimization. They generate lots of candidate algorithms and evaluate them and pick the best and then show that sure enough and it also does well on other similar evals. The whole thing is a little iffy since I know these algorithms can be finicky and it’s all preference-based with MT-bench and alpaca eval, but still cool that they were able to improve over DPO. We’ll see how it goes and if they can evolve code for other parts of the stack which seems a lot harder to optimize for and measure, but still cool to see people trying fun things like this. I can never resist evolution or computation.\nDigiRL-Agent: Learning the hard task of controlling a device via vision. They do offline RL based on annotated actions. This is what many others do and it does pretty poorly on real life. Benchmarks. But then they further train “online” RL with rewards based on vlm scoring. In other words, they have agents actually interact with a virtual device to carry out tasks. This translates to a huge improvement in performance on the “Android in the wild” data set.. they set a new state-of-the-art. I am not sure how well this generalizes outside of this specific task set/ domain. But it is very cool to see agents actually taking action even if it’s in a simulated environment and using that to improve versus just trying to use an off the shelf vision language model that does not have as much understanding as is needed to operate real world devices based on pixels only.\nCharachter AI post ‘Optimizing Inference’: Amazing post with a bunch of tricks from Noam Shazeer and crew. Key ideas they use when serving 20k qps: - Multi-Query Attention to reduce KV size - interleave local attention vs global attention (only 1/6 global) to speen things up. - Cross-layer KV cache sharing (between 2 or 3 consecutive layers) to reduce memory usage - Fancy caching to match as much as possible. All the focus is on keeping as much KV cache in mem as possible it seems. - They use int8 quant on weights, activations and KV cache, with fancy kernels. Train in int8 too.\nThe Many Ways that Digital Minds Can Know (Moultano): A fun way to look at some different axes we might care about re: LLMs. Interesting framing!\nMusings on typicality: A 2020 post from Sander Dieleman, helping explain why beam search isn’t ideal - linked from the recent review paper “From Decoding to Meta-Generation: Inference-time Algorithms for Large Language Models”.\nFinding GPT-4’s mistakes with GPT-4: Using a model to spot the mistakes of a model. Duuuuude. Cool work, having humans review outputs for RLHF seems like a spot where bugs could be missed, this appears to help a bunch with that (and will likely be a useful model for them to have lying around too!)."

Also, seems like they’ll soon have audio in -&gt; audio out functionality, it’s already in beta.\nFast Forwarding Low Rank Training - A funny technique: you do and SGD step then re-apply that same update again and again until the model stops improving on some tiny val set. Suprisingly they say this reduces total flops… I sort of feel if you’re doing DoRA/LoRA on a small dataset you don’t really care about flops and I’d rather show 10x the samples but who knows maybe useful.\nThe Moshi paper (PDF) - They wrap an audio model around a pre-trained text backbone, and have it produce text along with audio (‘inner monolog’).

My first test it was impressively close to correct (got some functionality, and to be fair claude also didn’t get this one-shot).

    "text": "Introducing the Kalman Filter\nThe Kalman filter is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone.\nKey concepts of the Kalman filter:\n\nState estimation: The filter estimates the state of a system.\nPrediction and update: It works in a two-step process: predict and update.\nUncertainty handling: It considers the uncertainty of both the prediction and the measurement.\n\nLet’s implement a basic Kalman filter for a 1D system:\n\nclass KalmanFilter:\n    def __init__(self, process_variance, measurement_variance, initial_estimate, initial_estimate_error):\n        self.process_variance = process_variance\n        self.measurement_variance = measurement_variance\n        self.estimate = initial_estimate\n        self.estimate_error = initial_estimate_error\n\n    def update(self, measurement):\n        # Prediction\n        prediction = self.estimate\n        prediction_error = self.estimate_error + self.process_variance\n\n        # Update\n        kalman_gain = prediction_error / (prediction_error + self.measurement_variance)\n        self.estimate = prediction + kalman_gain * (measurement - prediction)\n        self.estimate_error = (1 - kalman_gain) * prediction_error\n\n        return self.estimate\n\n# Example usage\nkf = KalmanFilter(process_variance=1e-5, # try 1e-4, 1e-3\n                  measurement_variance=0.1**2, \n                  initial_estimate=0, \n                  initial_estimate_error=1)\n\n# Apply Kalman filter to our noisy signal\nkalman_filtered = np.array([kf.update(measurement) for measurement in noisy_signal])\n\n# Add to our plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nplt.plot(t, true_signal, label='True Signal')\nplt.plot(t, noisy_signal, label='Noisy Signal', alpha=0.5)\nplt.plot(t, kalman_filtered, label='Kalman Filter')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Kalman Filter Performance')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis implementation demonstrates the basic principles of the Kalman filter:\n\nWe initialize the filter with our best guess of the initial state and its uncertainty.\nIn each step, we first predict the next state (which is simply the current estimate in this simple case).\nWe then update our estimate based on the new measurement, weighing it against our prediction.\nThe Kalman gain determines how much we trust the measurement vs. our prediction.\n\nThe Kalman filter often provides smoother and more accurate estimates compared to simpler filtering techniques, especially when dealing with noisy measurements and systems with known dynamics.\nHmm, the plot shows the kalman filter line lagging behind the signal quite visibly, what could be going wrong and how might we fix it?\nThe lag is likely due to the Kalman filter’s initial parameters not being well-tuned for this specific signal. To improve it:\n\nAdjust process variance: Increase it to make the filter more responsive to changes.\nModify measurement variance: Decrease it if we trust our measurements more.\nImprove initial estimate: Start closer to the true initial state.\nAdd velocity to the state: This helps predict trends better.\n\nLet’s implement these changes:\n\nclass KalmanFilterWithVelocity:\n    def __init__(self, process_variance, measurement_variance, initial_estimate, initial_velocity):\n        self.process_variance = process_variance\n        self.measurement_variance = measurement_variance\n        self.estimate = initial_estimate\n        self.velocity = initial_velocity\n        self.estimate_error = 1\n        self.velocity_error = 1\n\n    def update(self, measurement, dt):\n        # Prediction\n        prediction = self.estimate + self.velocity * dt\n        prediction_error = self.estimate_error + self.velocity_error * dt**2 + self.process_variance\n\n        # Update\n        kalman_gain = prediction_error / (prediction_error + self.measurement_variance)\n        self.estimate = prediction + kalman_gain * (measurement - prediction)\n        self.estimate_error = (1 - kalman_gain) * prediction_error\n\n        # Update velocity\n        self.velocity += kalman_gain * (measurement - prediction) / dt\n        self.velocity_error = self.velocity_error + self.process_variance\n\n        return self.estimate\n\n# Improved Kalman filter\nkf_improved = KalmanFilterWithVelocity(process_variance=1e-3, \n                           measurement_variance=0.1**2, \n                           initial_estimate=true_signal[0], \n                           initial_velocity=0)\n\ndt = t[1] - t[0]  # Time step\nkalman_filtered_improved = np.array([kf_improved.update(measurement, dt) for measurement in noisy_signal])\n\n# Plot results\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nplt.plot(t, true_signal, label='True Signal')\nplt.plot(t, noisy_signal, label='Noisy Signal', alpha=0.5)\nplt.plot(t, kalman_filtered, label='Original Kalman Filter')\nplt.plot(t, kalman_filtered_improved, label='Improved Kalman Filter (with Velocity)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Improved Kalman Filter Performance')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, I see the kalman filter now follows the noise almost too closely - can we make an animation that shows a gradual change for different variance values?\nCertainly. We can create an animation that shows how the Kalman filter performance changes with different process variance values. Here’s how we can do that:\nIn these animations you can see how we go from smooth to jagged as we increase the process variance.\nCan we take a step back and write a ‘what’s happening here’ section? What is the goal? What do we mean ‘known dynamics’? How did adding velicuty improve things? How does this generalize?’\nCertainly. Let’s add a section explaining the concepts:"

    "text": "What’s Happening Here?\n\nGoal: The primary goal of the Kalman filter is to estimate the true state of a system from noisy measurements. In our case, we’re trying to recover the true signal from noisy observations.\nKnown Dynamics: This refers to our understanding of how the system evolves over time. In our simple example, we assumed the signal follows a constant velocity model (position changes linearly with time). In real-world applications, these dynamics could be more complex, like equations of motion for a spacecraft.\nAdding Velocity:\n\nInitially, our filter only tracked position, assuming the signal stayed constant between updates.\nBy adding velocity to our state, we improved our prediction step. Now, we can anticipate trends in the signal, making our estimates more accurate and responsive.\nThis is especially helpful for signals that change rapidly or have clear trends.\n\nGeneralization:\n\nThe Kalman filter can be extended to track multiple variables (like position, velocity, acceleration) in multiple dimensions.\nIt can handle non-linear systems using variants like the Extended Kalman Filter or Unscented Kalman Filter.\nThe core principle remains: combine predictions based on known dynamics with new measurements, weighing each by their estimated uncertainty.\n\nProcess vs Measurement Variance:\n\nProcess variance represents uncertainty in our model of the system dynamics.\nMeasurement variance represents uncertainty in our sensors or measurements.\nBalancing these determines how much we trust our model vs. new measurements.\n\n\nThis framework is powerful because it provides a systematic way to combine our knowledge of a system’s behavior with imperfect observations, resulting in improved state estimates."

The filter’s performance can be further tuned by adjusting the process noise (Q) and measurement noise (R) covariances.\nWhat’s with the state stuff? Can you give me an approachable explanation?\nCertainly. Let’s break down the concept of state in the Kalman filter:\n\nWhat is state?\n\nState is a set of variables that fully describe a system at any given time.\nIn our example, the state is a 3D vector, which might represent position, velocity, and acceleration.\n\nWhy use state?\n\nIt allows us to model complex systems more accurately.\nWe can track multiple related variables simultaneously.\n\nState transition:\n\nThe system model (A matrix) describes how the state changes over time.\nFor example, current velocity affects future position.\n\nHidden vs. Observable:\n\nNot all state variables are directly measurable.\nThe Kalman filter estimates these hidden states based on observable measurements and known dynamics.\n\nUncertainty in state:\n\nThe covariance matrix P represents our uncertainty about the state.\nIt gets updated with each prediction and measurement.\n\nReal-world analogy:\n\nImagine tracking a car. The state might include position, speed, and direction.\nYou can only measure position directly, but the Kalman filter helps estimate speed and direction based on position changes over time.\n\n\nThe power of the Kalman filter lies in its ability to estimate these complex, multi-dimensional states even when we can’t measure all aspects directly.\nAh OK, so we assume the system has some underlying state that we try to model even though we can only read, say, position. And so at each step we’re doing our best to update our estimate of the state (the underlying state) based on the measurements. How do we initialize things? I see a big error right at the start that settles out. Also how do we control the ‘gain’ if that’s the right word - how fast it updates?\nYou’ve got it right. To address your questions:\nInitialization: 1. Initial state (x0): Often set to a best guess or first measurement. 2. Initial covariance (P0): Set high to indicate initial uncertainty.\nThe large initial error occurs because our initial guess is likely off, but the filter quickly corrects as it processes more measurements.\nControlling the gain/update speed: 1. Process noise covariance (Q): Higher values make the filter more responsive but noisier. 2. Measurement noise covariance (R): Higher values make the filter trust measurements less, resulting in smoother but slower updates.\nTo reduce the initial error and control responsiveness: 1. Improve initial state estimate if possible. 2. Start with higher Q and lower R, then gradually adjust. 3. Use a “fading memory” factor to give more weight to recent measurements.\nAnimate what happens as we lower Q (plot a few values of R for each Q as different colored lines). Do this but for the data I loaded right at the start\nCan you add error bands to the plot?"

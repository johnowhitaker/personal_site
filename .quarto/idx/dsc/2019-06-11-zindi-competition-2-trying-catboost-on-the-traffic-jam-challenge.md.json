It is now closed, but we can still make predictions and see how they would have done. This was a very quick attempt, but I wanted to try out CatBoost, a magical new algorithm that's gaining popularity at the moment.\n\nWith a little massaging, the data looks like this:\n\n![](images/screenshot-from-2019-06-11-11-05-03.png)\n\nThe 'travel\\_time' (in minutes) and 'day' columns were derived from the initial datetime data. I'll spare you the code (it's available in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/johnowhitaker/catboost_traffic_solution)) but I pulled in travel times from Uber Movement, and added them as an extra column. The test data looks the same, but lacks the 'Count' column - the thing we're trying to predict. Normally you'd have to do extra processing: encoding the categorical columns, scaling the numerical features... luckily, catboost makes it very easy:\n\n![](images/screenshot-from-2019-06-11-11-13-48.png)\n\nTraining the model\n\nThis is convenient, and that would be enough reason to try this model first. As a bonus, they've implemented all sorts of goodness under the hood to do with categorical variable encoding, performance improvements etc. My submission (which took half an hour to implement) achieved a score of 4.21 on the test data, which beats about 75% of the leaderboard. And this is with almost no tweaking! If I spent ages adding features, playing with model parameters etc, I have no doubt this could come close to the winning submissions.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is definitely a tool worth adding to my arsenal. It isn't magic, but for quick solutions it seems to give good performance out-of-the-box and simplifies data prep - a win for me.\n\nThis was a short post since I'm hoping to carry on working on the AI Art contest - expect more from that tomorrow!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2019-06-11-zindi-competition-2-trying-catboost-on-the-traffic-jam-challenge.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","title":"Zindi Competition 2 - Trying CatBoost on the Traffic Jam Challenge","date":"2019-06-11","categories":["blogs"],"tags":["catboost","jupyter","ml","python","uber","zindi"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

I'm using Quarto, and in this TIL I document how to export your blogs from Wordpress to Quarto. The whole process took about 20 minutes, thanks to a [note](https://github.com/johnowhitaker/datasciencecastnet_blog/blob/master/_notebooks/2020-02-25-wordpress-export.ipynb) I left for myself last time I tried the process :) The steps are:\n\n- Export XML from wordpress. I used the standard process, Tools -> Export -> Export All (https://wordpress.org/support/article/tools-export-screen/) to get an XML file that contains all my posts etc.\n\n- Convert the XML export to markdown. I used https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown. I ran ‘npx wordpress-export-to-markdown’ in the folder containing the export, following the prompts to create files with the right date format. I chose not to place them in separate folders.\n\n- Copy-paste the files into a folder in your quarto blog\n\nTo actually have them show up in the blog you need to edit a couple of other files. Here's what blog.qmd looks like:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"DataScienceCastnet\"\nlisting:\n  contents: dsc\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: False\n---\n```\n\nAnd then in the main _quarto.yml we add it like so:\n```\nwebsite:\n  title: \"johnowhitaker.dev\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: blog.qmd\n        text: Data Science Castnet Blog\n        \n```\n\nThat's it - hooray for the TIL format that means this counts as a post :)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2023-08-11-convert_wordpress_to_quarto.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

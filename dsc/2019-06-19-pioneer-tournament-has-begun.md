I have some more posts in the pipeline, including some more Zindi fun. BUT, that will all have to wait. The next round of the Pioneer Tournament (pioneer.app) has begun, and I'll be entering and using this blog to share progress towards my goal: Creating rich new datasets (along with educational material on how to use them) for 'data-poor' regions using satellite imagery and other public data sources. Stay tuned for the first output, and enjoy this AI-generated music while you wait:

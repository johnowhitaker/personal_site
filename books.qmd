## Recommendations
I like recommending books to other people, and find that the best way to get good new recommendations is to find someone with overlapping tastes and then look for ones they like that I haven't read yet. In that spirit, here are some books/authors I've enjoyed that I can recommend:

#### Sci-fi:
- Anything by Asimov, anything by Douglas Adams (classics)
- Anything by John Scalzi. "Lock In" if you want more gritty detective action, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" for something more absurd and funny, "old man's war" for a good series
- The Three Body Problem (dark forest trilogy) by Cixin Liu is excellent sci-fi from a different perspective, loved it
- Seveneves by Neal Stevenson is great, as is lots of his other work
- The Martian and its sequels are fun, by Andy Weir

#### Fantasy:
- I like the Stormlight series from Brandon Sanderson. 
- Discworld series by Pratchett 

#### Non-fiction:
- The Righteous Mind: great book for understanding morality+religion
- I am a strange loop: Fun to see someone tackle an ambitious question for a second time (this is the same author as Godel, Escher, Bach)
- Reality + by David Chalmers: philosophy of mind through a modern lens, great overview of lots of philosophy topics and an excellent defence of simulation realism
- An Immense World by Ed Young, one of my favorite books. Animal senses and how their words differ from ours. Mind expanding. 
-The Seabird's Cry. Poignant look at amazing creatures and how we're changing their world, with a very poetic author.

# Jonathan Whitaker

## AI Researcher

I love working on new challenges, and tend to gravitate to any role that lets me exercise my key skills:

- Breaking down and understanding deep technical concepts. (research)
- Figuring out how to practically apply these to real-world problems. (consulting)
- Communicating these concepts with others. (teaching)

I also have an unusual grab-bag of extra skills or interest areas, which come in useful from time to time :)

## EXPERIENCE
#### AI Education and Research
**SEPTEMBER 2022 - PRESENT**

- Joined forces with Jeremy Howard and friends to build Part 2 of the Fast.ai course. We still meet twice a week to discuss the latest research and work on our own experiments, with the focus gradually shifting to LLMs
- Created the Hugging Face Diffusion Models Class, and currently co-authoring a book with some collaborators building on that work
- Sharing learning material through my Data Science Castnet blog and YouTube channel

#### Consulting - Generative AI
**2022 - PRESENT**

- Builder-in-residence at PlaygroundAI, where I helped train their first in-house Stable Diffusion variant and worked on numerous guidance, instruction-following, and sampling improvements (Jan - June 2023)
- Smaller clients, working on image classification + generation, text, and most recently 3D-related R&D 


#### Consulting - Data Science
**2017 - 2021**

- Senior Data Scientist at Zindi (a data science competitions platform)  where I was responsible for preparing data for competitions, creating baselines etc… an excellent way to get better across NLP, CV, and tabular domains!
- Various analytics and deep learning projects, with a specialty of mine being GIS and remote sensing work. 
- Helped create and deliver various online courses around data science, machine learning, and ‘big data’ in collaboration with Ixio Analytics (a consulting firm I was part of) and the African Leadership University. I was also a lead instructor for iXperience’s “Data Science” summer class.

### Come along for the ride as I dive into an ML contest (MABe 2 on AICROWD)

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/ae-tdBAuLD0 >}}

A long rambly video as I pick a contest and put together a series of entries getting up to the top of the leaderboard. The first ~20 minutes is mostly checking out some different contests and settling on the MABe challenge. THen it's deciding on an approach and periodically checking in to see how it's going.Feel free to pop questions in the comments. The pacing is slow (a more concise video should come out in a few weeks) - I recommend putting this on in the background and coding away at the challenge yourself. Hopefully there are some useful nuggets in there  -)

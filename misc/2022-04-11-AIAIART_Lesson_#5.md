### AIAIART Lesson #5

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGq6eWW-72E >}}

Welcome back to AIAIART! This lesson recaps some of the core ideas from part 1 (lessons 1-4) and sets us up for the next few weeks, where we'll look into some advanced new techniques like transformers for image synthesis and the recently-famous diffusion models. The live stream of this lesson ran a little long and had a couple of technical hiccups, so this video is a re-recording that tries to do a more high-level summary. If you'd prefer to follow along with the full-length video in which I actually run all the code and explain in more depth, that video is up on https://www.twitch.tv/johnowhitaker and as an unlisted video here - https://youtu.be/BHkLbzspdt8See links to past lessons and our Discord where you can ask questions and share your projects via the aiaiart github repository - https://github.com/johnowhitaker/aiaiart/blob/master/readme.mdThe colab link for lesson 5 - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cFqAHB/EQqDh0OHCIpikpQ04yzsjITXtusp=sharing

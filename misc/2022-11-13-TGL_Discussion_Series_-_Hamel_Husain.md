### TGL Discussion Series - Hamel Husain

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8s2egj4RlQ >}}

In this video, I chat with Hamel Husain, a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist passionate about making tools. Hamel is one of the most helpful and interesting people I've met. He turned the usual interview process on its head and decided to interview me too, so you get two for the price of one in this episode!

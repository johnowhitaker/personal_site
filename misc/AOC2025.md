Day 1:  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YRCgjcuAJ4) is day 1. ([dialog](https://share.solve.it.com/d/b004443523475274df5d756806394089)). I knew there was a nice floor-y way to do part two but between gabbling trying to verbalize my thought process and the inherent de-buff that being on video gives, I resorted to checking a range instead and immediately felt a little silly. Ah well - so it goes :)

Day 2: I recorded my solve attempt again ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7HU3vxeCWI), long and boring). I got bogged down in an optimization for part a that seemed like a good idea (and WAS a good idea on the sample data) but that knocked me off the rails a bit haha, code got worse and worse! I'd normally go on a walk, maybe if this happens again I'll pause the recording rather than trying to keep typing. Still, ended up with basically the same solutions as everyone else here, albeit with a small trick for part 1.

Day 3: Much smoother, My [dialog](https://share.solve.it.com/d/d59602c624d2ee1bcf68f4ee25915a18) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd6QB5Xk8-Y). Tea and slowing down for the win!

Day 4: My [dialog](https://share.solve.it.com/d/9100d5e09acee8e3a0da36ef7ed8010f), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0Wcbd9GhQ) (both short today)

Day 5: Getting into territory where diagramming helps, thinking hard helps, and thinking about memory + speed starts to come up :slight_smile: My [video](https://youtu.be/1ACIYLIgop4). A little cheeky that ||the sample has ids sorted while the main input doesn't! Good reason to look at your data :slight_smile: ||

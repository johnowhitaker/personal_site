### AIAIART Lesson 6

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjoR4GAMjzI >}}

AIAIART Lesson 6, diving into transformer models and their application to image synthesis. We'll start by playing with text generation and build all the way up to creating our own version of the original 'dall-e' model for text-to-image synthesis.

You can find it on https://www.twitch.tv/johnowhitaker and I'll also upload it to YouTube at some point and update this description then.

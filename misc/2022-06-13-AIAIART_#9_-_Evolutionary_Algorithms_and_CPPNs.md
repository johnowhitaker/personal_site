### AIAIART #9 - Evolutionary Algorithms and CPPNs

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F_sUjkjwps >}}

CPPNs (not CPNNs as I say throughout the video!!) Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks! How embarrassing  -)In this, the final lesson of AIAIART Part 2, we take a very high-level look at evolutionary algorithms and a class of networks called CPPNs. Then we use our understanding of CPPNs to see how they lead to modern architectures like SIRENs and NeRFs. Notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Od3xufd6SUe0-6SgGUJ8sIP8AYI8oEgDusp=sharingThe live lesson (about twice as long, with questions from chat) is up as an unlisted video - https://youtu.be/9MCLQHjHu8wIt's been such fun running this course! I hope you've enjoyed coming on the journey with me, and I look forward to seeing where things go next.

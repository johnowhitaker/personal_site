### TGL Discussion Series - Jason Antic

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZmGXWvZaG8 >}}

Jason is the creator of the incredible 'DeOldify' application for restoring historical photos, and one of the best experimentalists I've met. In this conversation we chat a little bit about his journey then dive into the nuts and bolts of what research actually looks like. Audio only since I lost power as recording started and didn't notice the video recording freezing.

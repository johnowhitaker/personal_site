### AIAIART Lesson 7.5

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBrlYBP4GZA >}}

Informal chat where we read through a few papers and look at a recent project. No central notebook for this lesson, but some resources we'll be talking about -- A brief shoutout to https://multimodal.art/ as a great way to keep up with things- CogView2 - Faster and Better Text-to-Image Generation via Hierarchical Transformers (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14217)- Denoising Diffusion GAN (https://github.com/NVlabs/denoising-diffusion-gan)- My project, CLOOB Conditioned Latent Denoising Diffusion GANs (https://johnowhitaker.github.io/cclddg/) and specifically the demo notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T5LommNOw4cVr8bX6AO5QXJ7D1LyXz2musp=sharing)I forgot to mention a few things -1) If you're curious how I organised the code into that library with nice docs and such - check out NBDev.2) The demo grids shown run from no conditioning (left) to fairly extreme conditioning (right) using classifier free guidance.  -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/johnowhitaker

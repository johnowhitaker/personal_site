### Paper exploration - Making Diffusion Models go BRRR!

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFNNjg3lM0w >}}

(Audio cuts for a minute but resumes at 4/55 - sorry about that)In this video we take a look at the paper 'Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) and then play with a quick code demo to get a feel for what is going on.Notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1/snVM2OpPuCiurRwNCmsBYokDh21/1tRusp=sharing (for demo purposes - to actually train these models see the training script in the repository)W&B Run - https://wandb.ai/johnowhitaker/k-diffusion-demo/runs/2m3srgo0Let me know what you think of this style of video! Shall I try to do more casual paper breakdowns or do we leave that to the pros What other types of content would you like to see

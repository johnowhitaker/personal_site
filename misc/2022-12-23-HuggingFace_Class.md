### HuggingFace Class

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY20iKOQ2zw >}}

 Unit 2 - Fintuning and Guidance (casual notebook walkthough),Looking through the notebooks for the huggingface diffusion models class, unit 2 - https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/tree/main/unit2We cover fine-tuning existing diffusion models on new datasets, guiding generation with additional loss functions and creating a class-conditioned diffusion model.I mention a vide for unit 3 but have since remembered that I already link the Stable Diffusion Deep Dive video so that's probably sufficient!

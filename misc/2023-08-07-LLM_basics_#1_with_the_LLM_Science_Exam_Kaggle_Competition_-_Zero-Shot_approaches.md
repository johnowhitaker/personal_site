### LLM basics #1 with the LLM Science Exam Kaggle Competition - Zero-Shot approaches

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/ddCYORu41Xs >}}

Talking about ways to use an off-the-shelf language model to solve a multiple-choice task. Covering -- Intro to the Kaggle competition- Benchmarking with GPT3.5- Using the OpenAI function calling API to enforce structure on answers- Using Llama2 as a classifier by examining the logits (next token predictions)- Using perplexity to evaluate question-answer pairsNotebook using the OpenAI API to test GPT3.5 - https://www.kaggle.com/johnowhitaker/benchmark-gpt3-5Llama2 demo notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lzfHOqCKg6k7HykHrf4qWJhhEO3I5VXjusp=sharing (quickly made for this video, don't trust the calculations, rather start with the below notebook)  Notebook testing different open models with the perplexity approach - https://www.kaggle.com/code/takamichitoda/llm-perplexity-ranking-ensemble (a good template to start experimenting since it shows how to run as a submission.

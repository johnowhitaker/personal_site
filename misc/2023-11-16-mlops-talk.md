### What The Kaggle LLM Science Exam Competition Can Teach Us About LLMs

Come for the LLM insights, and stay for the Llama-filled slides :)

I enjoyed how the same key things came up in multiple talks:
- Inspect your data!
- Build good evals
- Keep feedback loops short

My talk went into some themes that crop up in many different LLM projects, and how the Kaggle competition was a great way to explore them.

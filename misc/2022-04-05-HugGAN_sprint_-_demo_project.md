### HugGAN sprint - demo project

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSga1ByWbqs >}}

Come along for an informal look at making something for the #huggan sprint. We -- Create a dataset and upload it to the huggingface hub- Train a model on that dataset- Work around some issues getting the trained model to run on CPU- Deploy it as a demo spaceThere were one or two little snags so the final section of the video is longer than expected, but I figured they were educational and thus worth leaving in. I hope you find this useful and are inspired to add your own project! See you on the Discord,JEnd result - https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggan/Colorb/GANModel - https://huggingface.co/johnowhitaker/colorb/ganOrbgan model with links to training notebooks etc - https://huggingface.co/johnowhitaker/orbgan/e1HF gan info - https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/huggan

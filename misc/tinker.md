### Tinkering with Tinker

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/yId2PE5Qmqo >}}

My first impressions and initial few tests exploring Tinker, training an LLM to respond to all questions with 'foo' and then moving on to an RL example using a custom synthetic task and watching reward + accuracy go up and up :)

[Dialog](https://share.solve.it.com/d/e52b8889b9d3571c1a67eda01aa540f4), [Notebook version](https://gist.github.com/johnowhitaker/1d344202d525496e9664bab7c6196d05)

Really impressed by this so far, expect more Tinker tinkering in the new year :)

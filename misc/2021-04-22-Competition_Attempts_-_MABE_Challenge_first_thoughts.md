### Competition Attempts - MABE Challenge first thoughts

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5mSH1ajQkE >}}

Documenting my first experiments as I attempt the MABE Challenge on AICrowd (https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/multi-agent-behavior-representation-modeling-measurement-and-applications)- Visualizing some data- A sensible baseline- Trying a tabular approach (as a better baseline)- Experimenting with some fancier architectures for time series classificationI recorded this a few days after the competition started. And then I lost track of time, so sadly there will be no part 2!

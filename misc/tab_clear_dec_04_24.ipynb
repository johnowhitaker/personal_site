    "- https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking/ - fantastic post on reward hacking. Also yay, lilianweng is posting again after recently leaving openai. A boon for us all.\n",
    "- https://transluce.org/neuron-descriptions describing all neurons in Llama 3.1 8B with a fine-tuned model. See also https://goodfire.ai/ which lets you steer generation with SAE features, looks very cool\n",
    "- https://minihf.com/posts/2024-08-23-weave-agent-dev-log-1/ a representative sample of an interesting blog - the author is John David Pressman who I've been aware of since early latent diffusion stuff. Working on agents, and writing about LLMs and philosophy from a unique perspective. Also, and I mean this gently, very not normal. \n",

    "- https://www.interconnects.ai/p/openais-o1-using-search-was-a-psyop  more speculations on o1. I liked Sasha's talk [Speculations on Test-Time Scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PEJ96k1kiw) which we did a watch party for.\n",
    "- [Streaming Deep Reinforcement Learning Finally Works](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14606) Ever since a chat with @pcastr a while back I've been more bullish on RL. I just skimmed bits of this, but one day soon I'll be ready to dive into RL I bet. \n",

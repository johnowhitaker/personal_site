### Summarising Neuromatch Deep Learning Course in 20 minutes

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMQwCwEAij8 >}}

An overview of the content covered by the NMA Deep Learning course. This material is freely available online, so if this video sparks an interest do go and check it out - https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.htmlHuge thanks to NMA for sharing this great course with the world. If you get a chance, try and attend the actual summer school when it next runs - you'll get group learning, projects, mentorship and lots of other benefits. And if you know your stuff already, I can recommend being a TA! Every year I've done it I've ended the course excited about deep learning and education, and the student questions will push the boundaries of your knowledge  -)

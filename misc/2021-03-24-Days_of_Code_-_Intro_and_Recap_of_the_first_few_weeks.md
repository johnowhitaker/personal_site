### Days of Code - Intro and Recap of the first few weeks

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyPllP0S7iM >}}

I've been doing small coding projects every day and documenting them on https://johnowhitaker.github.io/days/of/code/,  but so far have been slacking on the 'public' part of 'learning in public' - in this video I share a brief glimpse of the projects done so far, in the hopes that I can follow it up with better videos as new projects happen.

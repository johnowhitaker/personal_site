### TGL Discussions Series - @EnzymeZoo

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tMLIxlE_6I >}}

@EnzymeZoo is an artist and developer. In this discussion, we chat about the community development work that goes into creating a tool like the Deforum notebook (https://deforum.github.io/). We explore how that project came together, how you can get involved and @EnzymeZoos general thoughts on AI art and creativity.Links -- [Deforum Discord](https://discord.gg/deforum) (user discord, but from there you can find the developer group as well)- [Jax diffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huemin-art/jax-guided-diffusion/blob/v2.7/Huemin/Jax/Diffusion/2/7.ipynb) notebook- [Disco Diffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alembics/disco-diffusion/blob/main/Disco/Diffusion.ipynb) notebook- List of tools by @pharmapsychotic which has many more notebooks and guides - https://pharmapsychotic.com/tools.html- More [creations using deforum on Twitter](https://twitter.com/searchq=%23DeforumDiffusion&src=typeahead/click)After we stopped recording @EnzymeZoo also asked that I mention/thank Stability AI. The release of Stable Diffusion was the catalyst for Deforum springing into existence, and they have since started supporting some of the developers behind this and other notebooks.

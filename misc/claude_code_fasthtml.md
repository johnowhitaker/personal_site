Building out a FastHTML application with Claude code, sharing some tips for finding good context and keeping control. NB: I think I left Claude code set to use Opus - hence the expensive session. Also, since recording this, Isaac (creator of MonsterUI) shared his cursorrules, which are another great ref for providing FastHTML context to AI: https://github.com/ai-evals-course/isaac-fasthtml-workshop/blob/main/.cursor/rules/fasthtml.mdc

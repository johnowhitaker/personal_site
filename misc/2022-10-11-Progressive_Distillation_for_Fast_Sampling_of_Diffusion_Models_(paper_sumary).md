### Progressive Distillation for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models (paper sumary)

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXuK6IRJlnk >}}

Having a bash explaining https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512 (and the follow-on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142) I've been busy working on https://johnowhitaker.github.io/tglcourse and hoping to record a bunch of videos for that soon - this informal video is mainly just a way to test the recording flow and get me back in the zone for making videos  -) Nonetheless, I hope it is interesting and useful! If you have questions please leave them in the comments below.PS - For the curious - Î· is a lowercase 'eta' but that kind of knowledge vanishes as soon as the camera is on me!

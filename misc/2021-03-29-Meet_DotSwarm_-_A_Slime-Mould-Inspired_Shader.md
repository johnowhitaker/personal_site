### Meet DotSwarm - A Slime-Mould-Inspired Shader

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnuwd_z9YGE >}}

I spent the weekend building https://observablehq.com/@johnowhitaker/dotswarm-exploring-slime-mould-inspired-shaders - a 'combination of an agent-based model and a continuum-based model' that basically lets you simulate hundreds of thousands of 'agents' laying down trails on a shared surface. A few simple rules gives rise to some incredibly complex behavior and some mesmerising graphics.The whole thing is written with webgl2 shaders, so you can explore the simulations in real-time in your browser and tweak the parameters to find new patterns. Let me know if you have any questions  -)

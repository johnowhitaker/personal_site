Hello there! I'm Johno Whitaker - welcome to my personal website :) 

## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist/AI Researcher now based in Portland Oregon. I like teaching and making courses. My current focus is on generative AI, flitting between several modalities. 

This website will hopefully become a central repository for everything I'm working on. You can already find my blog posts, videos and [TILs](tils.qmd) in the ['Everything' feed](all.qmd). If you're looking for even more info, you may also want:

- [Twitter](x.com/johnowhitaker) or [Sigmoid.social](https://sigmoid.social/@johnowhitaker) (@johnowhitaker on both, and most other platforms too)
- [The Generative Landscape](https://johnowhitaker.github.io/tglcourse/), a work-in-progress course on all things generative.
- My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnowhitaker/) - although fair warning it is rarely checked or updated.
- My [GitHub](https://github.com/johnowhitaker)
- My DataScienceCastnet [blog](/blog.qmd) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6gT9X2oXYcssfZu05RV2g) where I document some of the projects I've been working on.

## Consulting

I'm open to freelance/consulting work. You can find out more about my rates, availability and philosophy of work on [this page](work.qmd) or check out my resume [here](resume.md).

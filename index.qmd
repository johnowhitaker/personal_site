Hello there! I'm Johno Whitaker - welcome to my personal website :) 

## What's here?

This will hopefully turn into a central place to keep all the things I've worked on. You can already find my blog posts, videos and [TILs](tils.qmd) in the ['Everything' feed](all.qmd).

This site is made with Quarto - more info [here](about.qmd) if you want more info on how to make something similar.


## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist/AI Researcher now based in Portland Oregon. I like teaching and making courses. My current focus is on generative AI, which I was doing before it was cool. 

If you're looking for even more info, you may also want:

- [Twitter](x.com/johnowhitaker) or [Sigmoid.social](https://sigmoid.social/@johnowhitaker) (@johnowhitaker on both, and most other platforms too)
- My DataScienceCastnet [blog](/blog.qmd) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6gT9X2oXYcssfZu05RV2g) where I document some of the projects I've been working on.
- [The Generative Landscape](https://johnowhitaker.github.io/tglcourse/), a work-in-progress course on all things generative.
- My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnowhitaker/) - although fair warning it is rarely checked or updated.
- My [GitHub](https://github.com/johnowhitaker)

## Consulting

I'm open to freelance/consulting work. You can find out more about my rates, availability and philosophy of work on [this page](work.qmd).

Johno's Personal Website (under construction)

Hello there! I'm @johnowhitaker - welcome to my site. If you're looking for more info on me, you may also want:

My DataScienceCastnet [blog](/blog.qmd) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6gT9X2oXYcssfZu05RV2g) where I document some of the projects I've been working on.

[The Generative Landscape](https://johnowhitaker.github.io/tglcourse/), a work-in-progress course on all things generative.

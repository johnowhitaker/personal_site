title: "YouTube Channel Recommendations"
---

I *really* like YouTube. Because my YouTube is amazing! If you're careful, you can find so much amazing educational and inspirational content on there. I hope to rapidly grow this list into a catalog of my favourites past and present, so that you can find content without relying on the luck of the algorithm, and start to tune your own recommendations in interesting directions. I'm not including all the channels I like, but rather all the ones I think are *underrated* or which you might most want to see if you're interested in a particular topic. Roughly ordering starting with 'I drop almost everything to watch this' and down from there.

**Clearly very WIP**


- [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/@AppliedScience) - Ben Krasnow does incredible work and was a big inspiration to teenage me. DIY electron microscopes. Cutting edge materials science. Amazing explanations + demos of science concepts.
- [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere) - Incredible engineerig execution, a level above most engineering channels. 
- [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) - His 'Coding Adventure' series is a delight, illustrating graphics or code concepts in a very artistic way. Truly masterful to make hours-loing coding videos so engaging and beautiful.
- [suckerpinch](https://www.youtube.com/@tom7)

- [David Hilowitz Music](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidHilowitzMusic) - Cool music tech, he makes an amazing free plugin 'Decent Sampler' - many videos are "I made/found this quirky instrument, let's make a song with it, here's a sample library" all artfully filmed, scored and edited.

It turns out it's pretty easy to make GIANT bubbles! This feels like the kind of knowledge that should be more widespread.

The recipe I tried:

- 1:16 Dawn "50% less scrubbing": water
- 1tsp baking powder per cup of soap
- Inspired by [nighthawkinlight's recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINBSeCACow), I blended up a few strawberries with salt and soap and strained the result into the mix. (the theory being the super long DNA molecules from the strawberries help the bubbles ðŸ¤·). You'd probably get almost as much fun without this!

You make a loop of string (the more absorbent the better) attached to two sticks such that when you pull them apart the longer section of the loop drops down lower than the shorter section. Dip the loop in the bubble mix, pull it out, and then pull the sticks apart. Voila! It takes a little practice to release the bubbles and have them float, but pulling tubes works almost immediately. We got our neighbor's kids involved and they had a blast. 

Like all internet-spawned subcultures there is a vast depth to giant bubble making, with wikis full of recipes, exhaustive tests of additives like veterinatry lube, debates over optimal techniques... explore at your own risk, or stick with the simple recipe and have fun :)

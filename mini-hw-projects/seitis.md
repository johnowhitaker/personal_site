# Scanning EIT Imaging System (SEITIS) Attempt

A failed attempt to make a scanning electrical impedance tomography system. Built from old printer parts, I had the motion stage (jankily) working and some of the electronics, but never got around to finishing it. This interest in tomography eventually led to my thesis which DID work :)

# Exploring 3D-Printed Instruments

I've built up a bit of a collection of 3D-printed instruments:

This post is mostly to keep a list of models I've found and enjoyed so far - future ones will dive into some designs I make myself.

## Models

- Kazoo: https://www.printables.com/model/65397-kazoo - fantastic, try different materials for the membrane
- Ocarina: https://www.printables.com/model/728330-updated-12-hole-ocarina - amazingly high-quality sound
- Xaphoon: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3290629/comments (mine is heavily modified to take an existing alto sax mouthpiece). I don't think this is the final form for Xaphoon-style instruments, more experimentation needed.
- Tin whistle fippe: something lke https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5358806 I think, which I then scaled to fit different sizes of PVC.
- Jaw harp (Dan Moi): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3213075 - lovely, I print loads and give them away.
- Nose flute: I can't recommend either of the ones I've tried, I like the whistle part of the infamous "double penetrator" pictured above but for obvious reasons it's not a very appealing instrument to play and not one you can share with other people either!

So, that's the first post - these have mostly been sitting around since last year, but I'm getting back into more non-screen hobbies now that I'm working full-time so the collection will likely grow soon.

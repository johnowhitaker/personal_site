# Owning a 3D printer

I got my first 3D printer in 2018. It was a Creality Ender 3. I printed a lot of parts for my own projects but also paid off the cost of the printer by printing parts for other people I knew in the engineering department. At some point I printed an adapter that turned it into a pen plotter.

description: "Spinning off a new feed for small lab notes, for things that are too small for a full post, but still worth sharing."

My bio practice is turning out to involve lots of longer-term projects, and while individual chunks/experiments can be interesting, I usually want to wait for things to accumulate before they get a full post/video. I thought youtube shorts might work as a venue for smaller in-progress updates but 1) video is still high friction and 2) they get shown to thousands of people, usually as a first impression. So, I made my own feed where I can post pics of my physical lab notebook along with other reference pics and notes: [https://ln.johnowhitaker.com/](https://ln.johnowhitaker.com/). I'll still try to keep things coming through to this blog, but hopefully this will avoid me polluting the everything feed here with too much everything :)

Why post all these? Adam Savage said "The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down." I've been taking notes, but I was chatting recently with Sebastian Coechiba and he encouraged me to make sure everything I capture is public, otherwise others can't benefit from it. So, Seb, here you go - my public lab notebook :)
